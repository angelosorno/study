    <shortdescription>Name means "red" or "man." He is the first man, created by God, whose wife was Eve. Adam was given authority over the earth. Sin came through Adam and Eve eating the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden, their home that was lost, but to be restored.</shortdescription>
    <article>The first member of the human family, created by God from the dust of the earth (Gen 2:7). His wife, Eve, was formed out of a rib from his side (vs 21, 22). Adam was given authority over the earth and all living creatures (ch 1:26) and was commanded to populate the world (v 28). He and his wife were placed in a “garden eastward in Eden,” and were given the task of caring for it (ch 2:8, 15). The product of plant and tree was to be their food (ch 1:29). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Adam and Eve were created perfect (Gen 1:31), and thus sinless. But they were also created with the power of choice, and thus had the freedom to disobey God. They were tested by means of “the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,” the fruit of which God forbade them to taste or even to touch (chs 2:17 3:3). Eve was beguiled by the serpent to eat of the tree, and then persuaded Adam to eat also (ch 3:1–7). By this act of disobedience they brought the curse of sin upon themselves and their children, and were expelled from the garden (vs 8–24). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
After the expulsion from the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve became the parents of Cain, Abel, Seth, and “sons and daughters” (chs 4:1, 2, 25 5:4). Adam was 930 years of age at his death (ch 5:5). It is not known how long he lived in Eden, although it was only a comparatively short period, for he was only 130 years old when Seth was born (v 3), which was evidently some time after the expulsion (cf. ch 4:1–25). Through the sin of Adam death came upon the entire human family (Rom 5:12–14 Eph 2:12). However, Christ, the second Adam (1 Cor 15:45–47), overcame where the first Adam failed (cf. Mt 4:1–10), and by His sacrifice made our redemption from the results of Adam’s sin possible (Heb 5:9 9:28).</article>

    <shortdescription>Meaning of name: "worker in iron" or "spear." He was the oldest son of Adam and Eve and the brother and murderer of Abel. He was a worker of the soil and offered his produce as an offering to God. The Lord rejected his offering but accepted Abel's.</shortdescription>
    <article>The eldest son of Adam and Eve, brother and murderer of Abel. A farmer by occupation, he offered as a sacrifice the produce of his fields. When God rejected his offering and accepted that of his brother, Cain became jealous and murdered his brother (Gen 4:1–16). The New Testament indicates an ethical cause for the rejection of Cain. Abel was righteous (Mt 23:35), while the way of Cain (Jude 11) was evil. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
John says that Cain was of that wicked one and that he slew his brother because his “works were evil, and his brother’s righteous” (1 Jn 3:12). The author of Heb 11:4 implies that lack of faith was the reason for the rejection of Cain’s offering. As punishment for his crime Cain was forced to live the life of an exile. He was given a mark, the exact nature of which is not known, as a protection or sign of protection against blood revenge (Gen 4:15, 16).</article>

    <shortdescription>Meaning of name: "breath." He was the second son of Adam and Eve. Abel was put to death by his brother Cain when his sacrifice was accepted by God and his brother's was not. Abel was a shepherd.</shortdescription>
    <article>The second son of Adam and Eve (Gen 4:2 etc.). The one incident of his life that Scripture records is his offering of a more acceptable sacrifice than that of his brother Cain (vs 3–5). Abel’s offering was noteworthy in that, being of the flock, it bespoke his faith in the promised Deliverer, the true Lamb of God, who was to bruise the serpent’s head (Gen 3:15 Jn 1:29). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The shedding of its blood was an acknowledgment on the part of Abel that he was a sinner in need of divine mercy and forgiveness (see Lev 17:11 Heb 9:22). Furthermore, Abel’s offering was of the choicest of the flock—a “firstling,” and “of the fat thereof”—and as such, an evidence of his readiness to give the Lord the best he had. Abel’s faithfulness won for his name a place of honor among the worthies of Heb 11.</article>

    <shortdescription>As a punishment for murdering his brother Abel, Cain is forced to live in exile and is given a mark as a protection against blood revenge. The exact nature of the mark is unknown.</shortdescription>
    <article>Some commentators have seen in this mark an outward sign attached to Cain’s person, whereas others believe that he received a sign from God as a divine pledge that nothing would endanger his life. Whatever it was, it was not a sign of God’s forgiveness but only of temporal protection.</article>

    <article>The son of Jared, and father of Methuselah (Gen 5:21; Luk 3:37). His father was one hundred and sixty-two years old when he was born. After the birth of Methuselah, Enoch “walked with God three hundred years” (Gen 5:22-24), when he was translated without tasting death. His whole life on earth was three hundred and sixty-five years. He was the “seventh from Adam” (Jud 1:14), as distinguished from the son of Cain, the third from Adam. He is spoken of in the catalogue of Old Testament worthies in the Epistle to the Hebrews (Heb 11:5). When he was translated, only Adam, so far as recorded, had as yet died a natural death, and Noah was not yet born. Mention is made of Enoch's prophesying only in Jud 1:14.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jude 1:14, 15 records Enoch's prophecy. Some believe he is quoting from the pseudepigraphical book of 1 Enoch and others believe this noncanonical book quoted Enoch.</shortdescription>
    <article>The statement that “he walked with God” after Methuselah’s birth does not imply that he had been a godless person before and only now experienced conversion. He belonged to the faithful race and doubtless had served God loyally during the first 65 years of his life. But with the arrival of a son to grace his home he understood through experience the depth of a father’s love and the confidence of a helpless baby. As never before he was drawn to God, his own heavenly Father, and eventually qualified for translation. His walk with God consisted not only in the contemplation of God but also in active ministry on behalf of his fellow men. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
He looked forward to the second Advent of Christ, earnestly and solemnly warning the sinners around him of the terrible doom that awaited the ungodly (Jude 14, 15).  Jude’s reference to Enoch and his quotation of that patriarch’s prophecy has occasioned much comment. Commentators are in general agreement that the pseudepigraphical book called 1 Enoch was in circulation among the Jews by the middle of the 1st century b.c.. Chapter 1:9 of this noncanonical work reads as follows: “And behold! He cometh with ten thousands of His holy ones to execute judgment upon all, and to destroy all the ungodly: and to convict all flesh of all the works of their ungodliness which they have ungodly committed, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him” (R. H. Charles, The Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament, Vol. 2, p. 189). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It is commonly believed that Jude quoted from this noncanonical work, though some hold the reverse to have been the case. If Jude quoted from 1 Enoch it was because the Holy Spirit led him to do so.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <article>A descendant of Seth and son of Methuselah. When he was 182 years old his son Noah was born. He named the child Noah, meaning “rest,” or “comfort,” perhaps expecting this son to bring rest for him and his contemporaries from the curse under which the human race lived. He died at the age of 777 years (Gen 5:25, 28–31).</article>

    <shortdescription>Meaning of name: "rest." He was son of Lamech, grandson of Methuselah. For 250 years he was a contemporary with Adam. Noah is a link between the old and new world and the second great progenitor of the human race. He was a builder and preacher.</shortdescription>
    <article>Noah was one of the ancient patriarchs, the 10th in order of descent beginning with Adam (Gen 5:3–29 1 Chr 1:1–4). His sons belonged to the last generation of the antediluvian period, and Noah through his sons became the progenitor of the whole human race that lived on earth after the Flood. He was the son of Lamech of the lineage of Seth, and like his ancestor Enoch was a man who “walked with God” (Gen 6:9). He was about 480 years of age when God announced the coming Flood to him (ch 6:3 cf. ch 7:6) and gave him instructions to build a ship in which he and his family would be saved (ch 6:13–21). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
A few years later 3 sons were born to him (ch 5:32), who with their wives were saved in the ark (Gen 7:7, 13 1 Pe 3:20). That Noah did more than simply build the ark for his family’s safety is indicated by the statement in 2 Pe 2:5 that he was “a preacher of righteousness.” He must have warned his fellow citizens of the impending catastrophe, but none of that wicked generation responded (cf. 1 Pe 3:20). When the ark was completed the Lord commanded Noah to enter it (Gen 6:22 to 7:5). With Noah also went in clean and unclean animals by pairs (ch 7:2–4, 8, 9, 14–16). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
God Himself closed the only door into the ark (v 16). Seven days later (vv10) began the Flood that destroyed all human beings and animals on earth, except those who were in the ark. The ark floated on the Flood waters for 5 months, and then came to rest “upon the mountains of Ararat” (Gen 8:4). After almost 21/2 months more the waters had subsided sufficiently to expose the mountaintops (v 5). More than a month later, by means of bird scouts sent out at intervals of 7 days, Noah was able to discover when the earth was dry enough for him to leave the ark. However, he did not abandon the ship until divinely commanded to do so (vs 6–19). Once on the outside he expressed his gratitude to God for his deliverance by building an altar and offering sacrifices. God accepted his offerings and made a covenant with him (chs 8:20 to 9:17).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Some time later Noah planted a vineyard, the first after the Flood, and became drunk with its product, an act that stands in marked contrast with his exemplary life as recorded elsewhere. While in a drunken stupor Noah exposed himself, and Ham, his youngest son, probably also Canaan, Ham’s son, seeing his shame, showed disrespect apparently by publishing the fact. The other 2 sons dutifully covered up their father. Because of Ham’s disrespectful behavior Noah later pronounced a prophetic curse on Ham’s descendants through Canaan, but a blessing on Japheth and Shem (Gen 9:20–27). Nothing more is known of the patriarch, except that he lived another 31/2 cent. after the Flood, reaching the age of 950 years (vs 28, 29). Ezekiel lists Noah with Job and Daniel as an example of righteousness (Eze 14:14, 20).</article>

    <shortdescription>Noah was about 480 years old when God announced a flood would cover the earth (Gen. 6:17) and 600 years old when the flood came (Gen. 7:6). In 2 Peter 2:5 we read that Noah was a "preacher of righteousness."</shortdescription>
    <article>Noah was a "preacher" or “herald”. From ancient times the office preacher was sacred and his person inviolable, since the herald was regarded as being under the immediate protection of the gods. Noah was the Lord’s “herald of righteousness,” that is, he proclaimed a message concerning righteousness. Josephus (Antiquities i. 3. 1 [72–74]) records the Jewish tradition that Noah tried to persuade his contemporaries to change their lives for the better (cf. on Gen. 6:3 1 Peter 3:19, 20).</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "God shall enlarge" or "beauty." He is the eldest son of Noah (Gen. 10:21), and with his wife were two of only eight people saved in the ark. He is blessed with his brother Shem for covering his father's nakedness (Gen. 9:23-27).</shortdescription>
    <article>Noah’s eldest son (Gen 10:21), born in the 500th year of Noah (chs 5:32 6:10). He was married at the time of the Flood (ch 7:7) but apparently had no children at that time (see 1 Pe 3:20). The only recorded incident concerning him tells of his and his brother Shem’s effort to save the honor of their father, whom Ham treated with disrespect. For this the two received special blessings. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It was predicted of Japheth that his descendants would occupy wide territories, and that they would “dwell in the tents of Shem” (Gen 9:20–27). Japheth became the progenitor of the Japhethite races among whom were the Medes, Ionians, and several nations who in OT times lived in what is now Asia Minor and southern Russia (ch 10:2–5).</article>

    <article>The youngest son of Noah, born after his father was 500 years old (Gen 5:32 9:24).

To Ham’s descendants belong the African and Arabian Cushites (Ethiopians see Ethiopia), the Egyptians, and the Canaanites.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "name" or "renown." He is the son of Noah (probably 2nd). He and his wife were saved in the ark. He was blessed and lived 600 years and was a contemporary of Abraham. The Israelite nation came from him.</shortdescription>
    <article>A son of Noah, possibly oldest, but apparently the 2d oldest, for Ham was the youngest (Gen 10:1 cf. ch 9:24), and Japheth seems to have been 2 years older, having been born apparently when Noah had reached the age of 500 years (ch 7:6 cf. ch 5:32), whereas Shem was born 98 years before the Flood, when his father was 502 years old (ch 11:10 cf. ch 7:6). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Consequently the rendering “Japheth the elder” in ch 10:21, KJV, seems to be better than that of the RSV, which declares Shem to be the elder brother of Japheth. Shem, his wife, his parents, and his 2 brothers and their wives went into the ark and were saved from the Flood (ch 7:7). In the post-Flood period Shem is mentioned with his brother Japheth as endeavoring to protect their drunken father’s honor following a shameful act by Ham. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
For this Shem received a special blessing (ch 9:20–27). Shem became the progenitor of the Semitic race to which the Babylonians, Assyrians, Aramaeans, Arabs, and Hebrews belonged (ch 10:21–32). Some scholars believe that the Sumerians were also descendants of Shem (S. N. Kramer, Analecta Biblica, 12 [1959], 202–204). The Hebrews were the descendants of Shem’s son Arpachshad or Arphaxad, who was born 2 years after the Flood (ch 11:10–26). Shem died at the age of 600 years (vs 10, 11). He is mentioned in the genealogy of Christ (Lk 3:36).</article>

    <shortdescription>The great deluge of water that covered the entire earth at the time of Noah, it came as a judgment on the wicked people of the earth. It is recorded in Genesis 6 to 9. Seven days before the flood came, Noah and his family and animals were in the ark.</shortdescription>
    <article>The tremendous extent and intensity of the Flood is well expressed by a graphic series of verbs and adverbs: the waters “increased” (v. 17), “prevailed” and “increased greatly” (v. 18), “prevailed exceedingly” (v. 19), and even “prevailed” 15 cubits (about 26 ft.) above the mountains (v. 20). The description is simple, majestic, and vivid. An immeasurable volume of water covered the whole earth. The universal extent of the Flood could hardly have been expressed in more forceful words than these. This description renders utterly foolish and impossible the view set forth by some that the Flood was a local affair in the Mesopotamian valley. Deposits of silt uncovered by archeologists at Ur of the Chaldees, for example, cannot by any stretch of the imagination be made to answer to the Genesis account of the Deluge.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Everywhere over the surface of the earth we find fossil remains of plants and animals obviously deposited by water. These deposits extend, in certain localities, to depths of at least three miles, but the average depth is somewhat over half a mile. The universal distribution of these remains and the depth of their burial testify unmistakably to both the worldwide extent and the terrific violence of the Noachian Deluge.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The universality of this catastrophe is also attested by the Flood legends preserved among the people of nearly every race on the face of the earth. Most complete among these accounts is that of the ancient Babylonians, who settled in close proximity to the place where the ark rested after the Flood and whence the human race again began to spread abroad. The Epic of Gilgamesh bears many conclusive similarities to that of Genesis, and yet differs from it in such a way as to prove it a corrupted version of the same story. A comparison of the two accounts presents impressive evidence of the inspiration of the Genesis narrative.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The ark is mentioned twice in vs. 17 and 18 as being “borne” or “lifted up.” That it “went” with safety “upon the face of the waters” provides all future generations with assurance of God’s ability to save those who trust and obey Him. The very elements loosed to destroy the wicked, safely bore up the faithful family of Noah. God is never at a loss for means to save His own. At the same time it is His will that man should exercise to the full the intelligence and strength God has given him. God miraculously preserved the ark, but He had Noah build it.</article>

    <shortdescription>After the flood, Noah builds a vineyard and becomes drunk. Ham discovers his father uncovered and tells his brothers who then cover their father. Noah then pronounces a curse on Ham for his reaction to his father's shame. The curse falls on Canaan.</shortdescription>
    <article>That Ham is again called the father of Canaan seems to imply that both father and son had similar unholy inclinations that revealed themselves, not only in the incident described here, but later in the religious practices of a whole nation. Furthermore, it shows that the event took place some time after the Flood, when Canaan, the fourth son of Ham (ch. 10:6), was already born. The sin of Ham was not an unintentional transgression. He may have seen his father’s shameful condition accidentally, but instead of being filled with sorrow over his father’s folly, he rejoiced in what he saw and found delight in publishing it.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The curse being pronounced on Canaan, Ham’s fourth son, rather than on the perpetrator of the crime himself, has been taken by many commentators as evidence that Canaan had really been the culprit and not Ham, and that he is meant in v. 24 as the youngest member of the Noachic family. The church Father Origen mentions the tradition that Canaan first saw the shame of his grandfather, and told it to his father. It is not impossible that Canaan had shared in his father’s evil deed. Noah’s curse does not seem to have been pronounced resentment, but rather as a prophecy. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The prophecy does not fix Canaan in particular or Ham’s sons in general in the bonds of an iron destiny. It is merely a prediction of what God foresaw and announced through Noah. Presumably Canaan already walked in the sins of his father, and those sins became such a strong feature in the national character of Canaan’s descendants that God later ordered their destruction.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Genesis 11 describes the whole earth having one language and people journeying east not a good move. Shinar is apparently the country of Babylonia and this is the plain on which the tower of Babel is built.</shortdescription>
    <article>&lt;b&gt;As they journeyed.&lt;/b&gt; As indicated by the verb “journeyed,” literally, “to pull out,” like the pegs of a tent, men lived a nomadic life for a time after the Flood. The mountainous region of Ararat was not well adapted to agricultural pursuits. Furthermore, those who forsook God resented the silent witness of the holy lives of those who were loyal to Him. Accordingly, there occurred a separation of the evil from among the good, with those who defied God leaving the mountains.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;From the east.&lt;/b&gt; The KJV translation “from the east,” for miqqedem, is misleading. The same Hebrew expression is translated “eastward” in ch. 2:8 and “east” in ch. 13:11. To reach the land of Shinar, Babylonia, from the mountains of Ararat, the direction of travel would of necessity be southeasterly, not “from the east” in a westerly direction.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;They found a plain.&lt;/b&gt; That is, a wide, open land. In antiquity the southern Mesopotamian lowland, often called “Shinar” in the Bible (see on ch. 10:10), was a well-watered, fertile region. The oldest known civilization, that of the Sumerians, thrived here. The spade of the archeologist reveals this land to have been densely populated in earliest historical times. This fact agrees with Genesis as to the locality in which a permanent settlement was first attempted. Excavations have shown, furthermore, that the earliest population of Lower Mesopotamia possessed a high culture. The Sumericans invented the art of writing on clay tablets, built well-constructed houses, and were masters in the production of jewelry, tools, and household utensils.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "rebellion" or "the valiant." He was the son of Cush and a great leader between the time of Noah and Abraham. He was not only a mighty hunter, but a monarch and builder of great cities like Babel, Erech, Accad, and Nineveh.</shortdescription>
    <article>One of the outstanding leaders in the period between Noah and Abraham. He was a son or descendant of Cush, but distinguished himself more than the other sons of Cush mentioned in Gen 10:7, 8, who appear only as ancestral heads of tribes. Nimrod is described as a mighty hunter, a monarch, the founder of the first kingdom on earth, and the builder of several famous cities, such as Babel, Erech (Uruk), Accad, Nineveh, and Calah (vs 8–12). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In Mic 5:6 Assyria is called the land of Nimrod, and to the present day Nimrod’s name clings to ruin sites for example, the site of ancient Calah in Assyria is now called Nimrûd, and that of ancient Borsippa in Babylonia is called Birs Nimrûd. It is still unexplained how Nimrod, a Cushite, gained so much influence and power in the Mesopotamian valley, the home of the Semites.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "the other side." He is the son of Salah from the line of Shem and regarded as the founder of the Hebrew race. The phrase "all the children of Eber" (Gen. 10:21) probably is the meaning of the word "Hebrews." Eber is mentioned in Luke 3.</shortdescription>
    <article>A descendant of Shem through Arpachshad and ancestor of a group of people called “all the children of Eber” (Gen 10:21, 24, 25), which phrase probably means the “Hebrews” in the broadest sense. To his descendants belonged the Joktanite Arabic tribes (vs 25–30) and the Aramaean tribes descending from Nahor and other relatives of Abraham (chs 10:26–29 11:16–27 22:20–24), besides Abraham’s descendants (ch 11:16–26), who included—in addition to the Israelites—the Ishmaelite Arabs, the Edomites, and the descendants of Keturah, Abraham’s later wife (chs 25:1–16 36:1, 8, 43). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In Num 24:24 the name Eber is probably used collectively for all these peoples. Eber is listed in Luke’s genealogy of Jesus Christ (Lk 3:35).</article>

    <shortdescription>Nimrod founded the kingdom of Babel (Gen. 10). Elsewhere in Scripture it is called Babylon. It means "confusion," though Babylonians refer to this city as Babilu, "gate of god." Probable seat of Nimrod's power and location of the tower of Babel.</shortdescription>
    <article>&lt;b&gt;The beginning of his kingdom.&lt;/b&gt; This may mean either his first kingdom or the beginning of his sovereignty. Nimrod appears in the register of nations as the author of imperialism. Under him society passed from the patriarchal form to the monarchical. He is the first man mentioned in the Bible as the head of a kingdom.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Babel.&lt;/b&gt; Nimrod’s first kingdom was Babylon. Having the idea that their city was the earthly reflection of the heavenly dwelling place of their god, the Babylonians gave it the name Bab–ilu, “the gate of god” (see on ch. 11:9). Babylonian legends equate the founding of the city with the creation of the world. No doubt with this in mind Sargon, an early Semitic king of Mesopotamia, took sacred soil from Babylon for the founding of another city modeled after it. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Even in the later period of Assyrian supremacy Babylon did not lose its significance as the center of Mesopotamian culture. Its greatest fame and glory, however, came in the time of Nebuchadnezzar, who made of it the world’s first metropolis. After its destruction by the Persian king Xerxes, Babylon lay partly in ruins (see on Isa. 13:19).</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "division." He is one of two sons of Eber, and "in his days the earth was divided" (Gen. 10:25) which either means people spread out after the flood or the confusion of language at Babel led to division. He was an ancestor of Abraham.</shortdescription>
    <article>A son of Eber and an ancestor of Abraham (Gen 11:16–26). His name had reference to the fact of that in his time the earth was divided (ch 10:25). The division referred to is either the general scattering of the descendants of Noah over the earth or the scattering resulting from the confusion of tongues (ch 11:7–9). A city at the mouth of the Khabur in Upper Mesopotamia was called Paliga, probably in honor of Peleg, in the same way as other cities in that area commemorated patriarchal names, such as Serug, Terah, and Nahor.</article>

    <shortdescription>Genesis 11 tells how people gathered on the plain of Shinar after the flood to "make a name" for themselves and build a city and tower "whose top is in the heavens." Babel means "confusion." Elsewhere in Scripture the city of Babel is called Babylon.</shortdescription>
    <article>The Tower of Babel. A term not found in the OT, but it is the name generally given to the structure that the early inhabitants of Shinar began to build, the progress of which was halted by divine intervention bringing confusion of tongues (Gen 11:1–8). The builders used bricks, because their country was completely void of stones. “Slime,” or asphalt, as mortar has been found in many Babylonian public buildings . It was obtained from open pitch wells at Hît, 120 mi. (c. 190 km.) north of Babylon. Of the Biblical tower nothing remains, but the idea of erecting towers was popular among the early Mesopotamians. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Practically every city of importance had at least one. These towers were called ziggurats, and were usually built in progressively smaller stages, and had on the top a shrine dedicated to the principal god of the city or of the land. The ruins of some of the ziggurats are still standing the best preserved are those of Ur in southern Iraq and of Choga Zambil near Susa in Iran, but even the remains of the ziggurats at Nimrûd, Qal‘a Sherqat, ‘Aqarquf, Birs Nimrûd, and Warka are impressive ruins. The temple tower of Babylon, mentioned in historical records from the beginning of the 2d millennium b.c., which was the highest and largest of all such structures which stood in historical times in Mesopotamia, has completely vanished. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Excavators found no more of it than its foundations and a few steps of its stairway. However, an ancient cuneiform tablet describes this tower, and Herodotus mentions it hence it is possible to get a fairly accurate picture of this famous structure. We know that it was about 300 ft. (c. 91 m.) square at its base, and more than 300 ft. (c. 91 m.) high, and that it was built in 7 stages, having on top as its 7th stage a shrine dedicated to the god Marduk.&lt;BR /&gt;
 &lt;BR /&gt;
Cain had built the first city (ch. 4:17), in an attempt, perhaps, to avoid the nomadic life God had marked out for him. God’s original plan called for men to spread over the face of the earth and to cultivate the soil (see ch. 1:28). The building of cities represented opposition to this plan. The concentration of human beings has always encouraged laziness, immorality, and other vices. Cities have ever been hotbeds of crime, for in such an environment Satan finds less resistance to his attacks than in smaller communities where people live in close touch with nature. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
God had told Noah to replenish, or fill, the earth (ch. 9:1). In fear of unknown or suspected dangers, however, men wanted to build a city, in the hope of finding security through the works of their hands. They chose to forget that true security comes only in trusting and obeying God. The rapidly increasing descendants of Noah must have departed very soon from the worship of the true God. In the fear that their evil ways would again invite catastrophe, they sought protection.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Building a tower would give inhabitants of the city the desired feeling of security. Such a citadel would protect them against attack, and enable them, they believed, to escape another flood—which God had promised should never be. The Flood had covered the highest mountains of the antediluvian world, but had not reached “unto heaven.” If, therefore, a structure higher than the mountains could be erected, men reasoned, they would be safe whatever God might do. Archeological excavations reveal that the earliest inhabitants of Lower Mesopotamia erected many towerlike temples dedicated to the worship of various idol deities.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Tower of Babel was to have been a monument to the superior wisdom and skill of its builders. To establish a “name,” or reputation, for themselves, men have been willing to endure hardship, danger, and privation. The desire for renown was apparently one of the impelling motives for building the tower, and pride in such a structure would, in turn, tend to maintain unity in the accomplishment of other unsanctified schemes. According to the divine purpose, men were to have preserved unity through the bond of true religion. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When idolatry and polytheism broke this inner spiritual bond, they lost not only unity of religion but also the spirit of brotherhood. A project such as the tower, to preserve by outward means the inward unity which had been lost, could never succeed. Obviously, only those who had forsaken God took part in these activities.  The Tower of Babel represented doubt of God’s word and defiance of His will. It was designed as monument to apostasy and as a citadel of rebellion against Him. This was but the first step in an evil master plan to control the world. Prompt and decisive action was called for, to warn men of God’s displeasure and to frustrate their wicked schemes. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
That men may be assured that God is not arbitrary in His dealings and does not act on sudden impulse, He is represented as taking counsel with Himself. The reason for His intervention is clearly stated. Except for the restraining power of God exercised from time to time in the course of history, the evil designs of men would be carried forward to success, and society would become wholly corrupt. The comparative order in society today is due to the restraining power of God. Satan’s power is definitely limited (see Job 1:12 2:6 Rev. 7:1).</article>

    <shortdescription>Excavations have shown that Nineveh was one of the oldest cities of Upper Mesopotamia</shortdescription>
    <article>Out of that land went forth Asshur. Even though this translation is possible, the sentence construction in Hebrew favors that given by the RSV, which retains Nimrod as the subject and reads, “From that land he went into Assyria.” In Micah 5:6 Assyria is called “the land of Nimrod.” Nimrod’s move into Assyria and his renewed building activity there constituted an extension of his empire in a northerly direction. What Assyria lacked in geographical size it made up in political power later in its history.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Nineveh.&lt;/b&gt; For centuries Nineveh was famous as the capital of Assyria. The Assyrians themselves called it Ninua, apparently dedicating it to the Babylonian goddess Nina. This points to Babylon as Nimrod’s previous home and agrees with the Biblical report that he, the first king of Babylon, was also founder of Nineveh. Excavations have shown that Nineveh was one of the oldest cities of Upper Mesopotamia. Lying at the intersection of busy international trade routes, Nineveh early became an important commercial center. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It changed hands repeatedly during the second millennium b.c., belonging in turn to the Babylonians, Hittites, and Mitannians before being brought under Assyrian control in the 14th century b.c. Later, as capital of the Assyrian Empire, it was embellished with magnificent palaces and temples and strongly fortified. In 612 b.c. the city was destroyed by the Medes and Babylonians, and has since then remained a heap of ruins. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In its famous library, established by Ashurbanipal, have been found thousands of baked clay tablets containing invaluable historical, religious, and business documents and letters. Above all others, this discovery has enriched our knowledge of ancient Assyria and Babylonia.  Nichol, Francis D.: The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, Volume 1.

    <shortdescription>Name possibly means "tested" or "persecuted." He is a non-Israelite worshiper of God who is very wealthy but loses all his possessions and children and wrestles with the question, "Why?" The book ends with Job recognizing God's sovereignty.</shortdescription>
    <article>A pious believer in the true God who lived in the land of Uz principal character in the book of Job (Job 1:9). Ezekiel (Eze 14:14, 16, 20) and James (Jas 5:11) refer to him as an ideal example of patience and righteousness. Job doubtless lived in patriarchal times, as the social, historical, and cultural setting of the book suggests. The land of Uz has not been identified with any particular locality, but references in the book of Job and data provided by Josephus (Ant. i. 6. 4). and Ptolemy locate Uz east of Palestine proper on the borders of the Arabian Desert, certainly south of Damascus and probably in the vicinity of Edom (see Lam 4:21). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The land of Uz may have taken its name from a son of Shem (1 Chr 1:17) who settled there in early times. A son of Nahor, the brother of Abraham, bore the same name (Gen 22:21, RSV) the Hebrew word translated “Huz” is identical with that translated “Uz.” The Chaldeans (Job 1:17) are known to have crossed the Arabian Desert and raided the region of Edom. The Sabeans were the people of Sheba (ch 1:15), far to the South of Edom (cf. Is 45:14). Teman (Job 2:11) was in the land of Edom. The land of Shuah (ch 2:11) was probably to the north of Edom and southwest of the Euphrates. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Job was apparently a wealthy herdsman (see chs 1:3, 4 42:12), a leader honored and respected by his fellow townsmen for his wisdom and good counsel and who took a practical interest in the welfare of all who needed his help (ch 29:7–17). He lived in a “city” and was apparently one of its elders (v 7). From a human point of view there was no reasonable explanation of why an upright man like Job should suffer the terrible calamities that came upon him (ch 1:13–21). He did not understand why tragedy had come, but nevertheless maintained his confidence in God (Job 23). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Despite the mistaken admonition of his wife and his friends Eliphaz, Bildad, Zophar, and Elihu (chs 2:9, 11 32:2), he maintained his “integrity.” In the end God sternly rebuked the misguided philosophy of Job’s friends, that Job’s calamities were a divine retribution for his misdeeds (ch 42:7). The turning point in Job’s experience came when he prayed for his friends, and the Lord gave him “twice as much as he had before” (v 10).&lt;BR /&gt;

        <VideoDescription>There is a battle going on behind the scenes for our hearts, the devil wants us to turn our hearts away from God, he wants us to curse God.  The story of Job is an example of someone who praised God even in the midst of difficult trials.  The Lord withdrew his protection from Job, and the devil took everything away from him, yet Job still did not curse God. The book of Job is a miniature example of the story of salvation.</VideoDescription>

    <shortdescription>Name means "father of a multitude." He is the son of Terah and father of Isaac. Abram, later Abraham, was called by God to leave Ur and go to the land of Canaan where his descendents would become a great nation. He is known as a friend of God.</shortdescription>
    <article>Abraham was born in 1950 b.c. left Haran for Canaan after the death of his father in 1875 b.c., visited Egypt between 1875 and 1864 b.c., and died in 1775 b.c. after having lived in Canaan for 100 years. He was born in Ur in southern Mesopotamia during the Neo-Sumerian period. In about 1960 b.c., according to the so-called Low Chronology, shortly before his birth, the strong 3d dynasty of Ur, which had ruled for more than 100 years, came to an end, and was replaced by the rival dynasties of Isin and Larsa, under which Ur declined somewhat in importance as a political center in the Mesopotamian valley. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
During the 75 years that Abraham lived in Ur and Haran the country was under the domination of Sumerian rulers, although the Amorites, who had already taken over most of Syria and Palestine, were already pouring into Mesopotamia. By 1830 b.c. they founded the powerful 1st dynasty of Babylon, whose 6th king, Hammurabi (c. 1728–1686 b.c.), became the strongest ruler.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When Abraham entered Canaan he found the country for the greater part in the hands of the Amorites. The country was not a unified state, however, but consisted of numerous city-states of various sizes with kings and kinglets of Amorite stock forming the ruling class. Egypt, on the other hand, was at that time ruled by the powerful kings of the 12th dynasty (1991 to c. 1780 b.c.). If Abraham was in Egypt between 1875 and 1864 b.c. (see Gen 12) he must have met Sesostris III as king of Egypt who ruled from 1878 to 1840 b.c. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
According to ancient records this king conducted a military campaign into Palestine, directing it against Skmm, which is probably Shechem, but did not occupy the country. It seems that the campaign was a punitive raid, and that its object was not conquest.  During Abraham’s time occurred the military campaigns described in Gen 14. None of the kings mentioned in the narrative can be identified with monarchs known from secular sources, however, archeological evidence confirms the narrative. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The explorations of Albright and Glueck have brought to light evidence that a flourishing culture and many cities in Transjordan were destroyed in the 20th or 19th cent. b.c., and that the country remained almost entirely uninhabited for several centuries afterward. There is also some evidence that Sodom and Gomorrah, which presumably lay at the southern end of the Dead Sea, were destroyed at that time (see Sodom). The cities Sodom and Gomorrah are mentioned in a cuneiform text from *Ebla of the prepatriarchal period.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The life of Abraham may be considered under four major periods: (1) His life prior to his journeying to Canaan, at the age of 75. (2) His early sojourn in Canaan to the birth of his son Isaac, a period of 25 years. (3) His life from the birth of Isaac to the death of Sarah and the marriage of Isaac to Rebekah, about 40 years. (4) His later life, old age, and death, about 35 years.</article>

    <shortdescription>Her name means "princess." She is the daughter of Terah and wife and sister of Abram. They had the same father, but not the same mother. Sarai, later Sarah, became the mother of a promised child (Rom. 4:19), Isaac, through whom the Savior came.</shortdescription>
    <article>The wife of Abraham (Gen 11:29) and daughter of his father, but not of his mother (ch 20:12). She was about 10 years younger than Abraham (ch 17:17), and was therefore about 65 years old when her husband left Haran at the age of 75 (ch 12:4). Shortly after their arrival in Palestine a famine broke out which forced them to go to Egypt to keep their large household alive. Fearing that Sarah’s beauty would, in spite of her age, attract the attention of the Egyptians, Abraham pretended she was his sister. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Posing now as unmarried, she was taken to Pharaoh’s harem. But the king returned her to Abraham when her true status became known, with a rebuke for Abraham’s deception and a request that Abraham leave the country (vs 10–20). Abraham did not profit by this experience, but again passed off Sarah as his sister, this time in the country of Abimelech of Gerar (ch 20:1–18). When about 75 years of age (cf. chs 16:16 17:17) Sarah despaired of ever becoming a mother, and requested her husband to have a child through Hagar, her Egyptian slave. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In making this proposal Sarah followed a custom of her native Mesopotamia. The result was the birth of Ishmael (ch 16:1–16). Later, when about 89 years old, Sarah received a definite promise that she would give birth to a son within a year. It was on this occasion that her name, which had hitherto been Sarai, was changed to Sarah. The promise was fulfilled in the birth of Isaac. During Isaac’s weaning feast Sarah saw Ishmael tormenting Isaac (Gen 21:9 Gal 4:29), whereupon she demanded that Ishmael and Hagar be expelled from the family. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
At God’s direction Abraham reluctantly obeyed (Gen 21:9–14). Nothing more is recorded of Sarah except that she died at the age of 127 at Kiriath-arba, or Hebron (Gen 23:1, 2). She was buried in the Cave of Machpelah, which Abraham bought after her death as a family sepulcher (vs 19, 20). Isaiah refers to Sarah as the mother of the Israelite nation (Is 51:2), and Paul writes of her as the mother of the child of promise (Rom 4:19 9:9). Peter mentions her as an example of a good wife (1 Pe 3:6), and in Heb 11:11 she is praised for her faith.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "veil" or "covering." He is the son of Haran and a nephew of Abraham. He went with his uncle to Canaan and after their shepherds quarreled about pastures, they separated. Lot chose the Jordan Valley and later lost his wife near Sodom.</shortdescription>
    <article>Son of Abraham’s brother Haran (Gen 11:26, 27). Lot went with his grandfather’s family from Ur to northern Mesopotamia (v 31). Later he accompanied Abraham to Canaan (ch 12:4, 5), and also to Egypt (ch 13:1). Like his uncle Abraham, Lot had large flocks, and when the shepherds of the two families quarreled about the available pasturage, Abraham suggested a separation. Lot agreed and chose the Jordan Valley. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Ultimately he selected the prosperous but wicked city of Sodom as his residence (vs 5–13). When Chedorlaomer and his confederates captured Sodom, Lot and his family were carried away as prisoners, but were rescued by Abraham and then returned to Sodom (ch 14:12, 16). The wickedness of the cities in the area where Lot dwelt became so great that God decided to destroy them. However, since Lot was a righteous man (2 Pe 2:7, RSV), angels were dispatched to rescue him and his family. Appearing in human form, the angels were received in Lot’s hospitable home. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When the Sodomites attempted to ravish Lot’s guests, he considered himself bound, according to the Oriental custom of hospitality, to protect the honor and lives of his guests at any cost—in this case even if it would have meant giving up his own daughters (Gen 19:1–14). The two guests admonished him to flee from the city in order to save his life and the lives of his family. However, his sons-in-law, and probably their families, ridiculed his message and refused to leave the doomed city. The next morning, urged by the angels to hasten on, Lot, with his wife and two unmarried daughters, fled from the city toward the small town of Zoar. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
His wife, neglecting to heed the divine instruction, perished during the flight and became a pillar of salt, possibly by being engulfed by falling masses of salt (vs 15–26). Lot and his daughters later fled into the hills, where they lived in a cave. During their stay in the lonely hills east of the Jordan, two sons were born to the daughters by incestuous unions with their father. They were called Moab (probably meaning “[seed] from father”) and Ben-ammi (“son of kinsman”), and were the ancestors of the Moabites and the Ammonites (vs 31–38). Lot’s memory still lingers on in the area of his stay in the modern Arabic name for the Dead Sea, Ba?r Lût, the “Sea of Lot.”</article>

    <shortdescription>Genesis 11 says that "Abram and Nahor took wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai." Central to the story of Abraham's family is the statement in v. 30, "But Sarai was barren she had no child."</shortdescription>
    <article>Abram’s wife, Sarai, was his half sister, a daughter of Terah by another wife than Abram’s mother (see ch. 20:12). Marriage with a half sister, and with other close relatives, was afterward forbidden by the Mosaic civil code, though apparently still permitted in Abram’s time (see Lev. 18:6, 9, 14).</article>

    <shortdescription>Terah takes his son Abraham, his grandson Lot, and his daughter-in-law Sarai and leaves Ur of the Chaldeans and goes toward Canaan. They first go to Haran where Terah later dies.</shortdescription>
    <article>They went forth. The Scriptures make it clear that Abram was the one to whom God revealed Himself in Ur of the Chaldees, and not to Terah, as might be inferred from this passage. Stephen told his hearers that Abram had left “Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, in response to an explicit command addressed to him personally of God (Acts 7:2, 3). God later reminded Abram that He had brought him out of Ur of the Chaldees (Gen. 15:7), not out of Haran (see also Neh. 9:7). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
We conclude that Abram’s call occurred in two stages. The first call, when he lived at Ur, was to leave his ancestral tribe, but the second, at Haran, was to forsake his immediate relatives, even his father’s house. When the first call came to Abram, he obeyed immediately and left the old environment to find a new home in the country God promised to provide for him. He must have had considerable influence over his father, Terah, his brother Nahor, and his nephew Lot, because they all chose to accompany him.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
To go into the land of Canaan. This indicates that Canaan was their destination from the very beginning. There were two possible routes of travel from Ur in southern Mesopotamia to Canaan. One route lay directly across the great Arabian Desert, but a large caravan of flocks, herds, and many servants could not possibly traverse such terrain. The other route lay up the Euphrates, across the narrow desert of northern Syria, and then through the Orontes valley southward into Canaan. This was obviously the way by which they must travel.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
They came unto Haran. Haran is situated on the Balikh river in northern Mesopotamia, halfway between Ur and Canaan. The reason for this interruption of the journey is not given, but it may have been occasioned by the attractiveness of the region, or more likely by the advancing age and feebleness of Terah. For the greater part of the family Haran became a permanent place of abode, which implies, perhaps, that the attractiveness of the region may have led to the original decision to stop there. The Balikh and Chabur valleys contain fertile pastureland. It is possible that the whole region was sparsely populated, and seemed to offer fine possibilities for increasing the wealth of the family before they proceeded on to Canaan.</article>

    <shortdescription>God calls Abram, later Abraham, to leave his country and father's house to a land where He will make him into a great nation. Genesis 12:4 says that at this time Abram was 75 years old. Lot went with them, along with all their possessions.</shortdescription>
    <article>Get thee out. Henceforward Abram is the hero of the Genesis narrative. This is the first recorded divine revelation to Abram, although it is known from Acts 7:2 that God had appeared to him at least once previously. The word of Jehovah begins with a command, continues with a promise, and ends with a blessing. These three significant aspects characterize every manifestation of God to man. The promises of God are fulfilled and His blessings received only as His commands are obeyed. Men are usually desirous of sharing God’s blessings and realizing His promises without cooperating with His requirements.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Lord’s call required Abram to make a complete break with the past. He not only had to leave the land of the two rivers, Mesopotamia, in which Ur as well as Haran was situated, but also had to give up family ties and even his father’s house, never to return to those of his own blood and race. It was a severe test. Haran and Ur shared the same civilization and standards of living. All this would change immediately when he should leave the land of the two rivers and cross over to Syria and Palestine. Instead of fertile grazing lands he would find a heavily wooded and mountainous country. Instead of living among related and highly civilized peoples, he would be sojourning among tribes of a materially lower culture and an especially degraded religion.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
A land that I will shew thee. Genesis 11:31 indicates that Abram’s original destination had been Canaan. Obviously, God must have specified Canaan as the land toward which he should direct his steps. Upon this occasion (ch. 12:1) Canaan is not mentioned, but it is clear that Abram knew Canaan to be the place where God wanted him to go. He set out with Canaan in mind (v. 5). Paul’s statement in Heb. 11:8 that Abram “went out, not knowing whither he went” apparently refers to the fact that henceforth he would have no certain dwelling place, but was to be a pilgrim and a stranger (see Heb. 11:9). Henceforth God would guide him day by day, and he would never know long in advance what the future might bring.</article>

    <shortdescription>Genesis 12 says that a "severe" famine came to Canaan so Abram "went down to Egypt."</shortdescription>
    <article>Abram had scarcely passed through the Promised Land when a severe famine compelled him to leave it. Canaan, though naturally fertile, was subject to visitations of drought, especially in those years when the November and December rains, on which the country depended, either failed or were scanty (Gen. 26:1 41:56 1 Kings 17:1 Haggai 1:10, 11). The occurrence of this famine just at the time of Abram’s entering the land was an additional trial of his faith. It was to teach him lessons of submission, faith, and patience. He was to realize that even in the Promised Land food and blessings come from the Lord alone. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Being in the south of Canaan, Abram found it natural to turn to Egypt, the country of plenty, to find sustenance. Although Egypt itself occasionally suffered from famine, because of failure of the Nile to overflow, it was known to surrounding countries as a haven of refuge in times of need. Ancient Egyptian records repeatedly mention the fact that Asiatics entered the country to feed their starving flocks.</article>

    <shortdescription>Abram takes his family to Egypt because of a severe famine. He is worried he will be killed and his beautiful wife taken from him, so he tells Sarai to say she is his sister. Pharaoh takes Sarai but his household is plagued. He learns Abram has lied.</shortdescription>
    <article>This is his wife. Abram was to discover in Egypt that human cunning is worthless and that deliverance from fear and perplexity comes only from the Lord (Ps. 105:14, 15). Approaching Egypt Abram feared for his life on account of the beauty of Sarai, his wife. Since she was his half sister, he felt justified in asking her to pass herself off as his sister (see Gen. 20:12). The conduct of the Canaanites, as seen later in the case of the men of Sodom (ch. 19:4–11), is evidence that he had reason for his anxiety. His experience in Egypt shows even more clearly that, from a human point of view, his fears were well founded. But the precaution he took did not spring from faith. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
She was very fair. How could Sarai at the age of 65 have been as attractive as this incident suggests? It should be remembered that in Abram’s time the life span was twice what it is now, and Sarai, who died at the age of 127 (ch. 23:1), was therefore in middle age. The Pharaohs are known to have fancied the fairer complexion of foreign women, and to have secured Libyan, Hittite, Mesopotamian, and Palestinian girls for the royal harem.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Lord plagued Pharaoh. Man’s extremity is God’s opportunity. Though Abram had failed God, God intervened on his behalf. What the nature of these plagues was cannot be determined, but they were obviously of such a nature as to protect Sarai from dishonor and to convince Pharaoh that he should restore her to Abram. Sarai herself may have revealed her actual marital status, or God may have spoken directly to Pharaoh as He did later to Abimelech (see ch. 20:3).&lt;BR /&gt;
This experience should have taught Abram to trust in God rather than in his own clever devices. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Take her, and go. Recognizing that the plagues had come upon him because of God’s displeasure, the monarch did not dare to deal harshly with Abram, but sought, rather, to mitigate the anger of God by providing him a safe-conduct from the country. The graciousness of Pharaoh and the mercy of God had humbled him, and in silence he acknowledged his guilt. What dishonor comes to the cause of God when His representatives, as the result of ill-advised and disgraceful courses of action, bring upon themselves well-earned reproof from men of the world!</article>

    <shortdescription>When God makes a covenant with Abram, the Lord predicts that Abram's descendents will be slaves in a foreign land for 400 years, but that God will free them with great possessions. Apparently 400 is a round number for they come out in 430 years.</shortdescription>
    <article>God predicted Abram's descendents would be slaves in a foreign land for 400 years. The questions to be answered are: (1) Is this the time of affliction or the time of sojourning, or both? (2) How are these 400 years related to the 430 of Ex. 12:40, 41 and Gal. 3:16, 17? The first question hinges upon a solution to the second.&lt;BR /&gt;
The statement in Ex. 12:40, that “the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years,” seems to imply that the Hebrews actually spent 430 years there, from Jacob’s entry to the Exodus. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
That this cannot be the meaning is evident from Gal. 3:16, 17, where it is stated that the law was promulgated at Sinai 430 years after the covenant between God and Abram. If Paul refers to the first promise made to Abram in Haran (Gen. 12:1–3), the 430 years began when Abram was 75 years old (ch. 12:4). The 400 years of affliction would then begin 30 years later, when Abram was 105 and his son Isaac 5 years old (ch. 21:5). This would be about the time Ishmael, who “was born after the flesh persecuted him [Isaac] that was born after the Spirit” (Gal. 4:29 Gen. 21:9–11).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The exact time from the call of Abram to Jacob’s entry into Egypt was 215 years (see Gen. 21:5 25:26 47:9), which would leave 215 years of the 430 as the actual time the Hebrews spent there. For this reason the 430 years of Ex. 12:40 must include the sojourn in Canaan as well as that in Egypt, from Abram’s call to the Exodus. The LXX renders Ex. 12:40 thus: “And the sojourning of the children of Israel, while they sojourned in the land of Egypt and the land of Chanaan, was four hundred and thirty years.” &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As already pointed out, the land of Canaan was so dependent upon Egypt during the patriarchal period that Egyptian kings actually considered it theirs and referred to it as such. During the Eighteenth Dynasty, whose kings controlled both Palestine and Syria, Moses could appropriately include Canaan in the term Egypt as used in Ex. 12:40.</article>

    <shortdescription>Abram and Lot have many flocks and "the land was not able to support them" (Gen. 13:6). Abram suggests they separate and gives Lot the choice of land. Lot chooses the fertile Jordan Valley and journeys "eastward" toward Sodom, a bad move.</shortdescription>
    <article>Their substance was great. The uncle’s prosperity overflowed upon his nephew. Lot, the only other member of Terah’s family who had obeyed God’s command to go to Canaan, shared in the blessing promised Abram. Inasmuch as the land was already occupied by the Canaanites, and the mountains of Canaan were heavily wooded, as ancient records show, there was scant permanent grazing land for the large flocks and herds of the newcomers.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Let there be no strife. The quarrels of the shepherds were probably reflected in Lot’s attitude and conduct. Anxious to avert discord and enmity between himself and his nephew, Abram proposed the separation of their flocks and herds as a solution to the difficulty. In view of the fact that Lot was his junior, and that the entire country had been promised to Abram, his dealings with Lot reflect a truly generous spirit. The nobility of soul revealed upon this occasion stands forth in sharp contrast to the weakness of character he had so recently exhibited in Egypt. Abram proved himself to be a man of peace.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Is not the whole land before thee? Though appointed heir to the entire country, Abram manifested true humility by subordinating his own interests to those of Lot and so permitting him to take as much of the land as he wanted. Abram waived his own rights for the sake of peace, but in so doing earned our highest respect. He displayed a generosity of spirit, a nobility of mind, a character worthy of emulation. To do otherwise than he did would have been to follow the selfish principles that usually govern men in their dealings with one another. But a spiritual man lives according to higher principles and looks beyond the temporary advantages of this world to eternal gains. This Abram did by defeating Satan’s purpose to create discord and strife between him and his nephew.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Lot chose. Allured by its beauty and fertility and heedless of other considerations, Lot chose the Jordan valley as his future place of abode. Impelled by selfishness and guided only by his own inclinations and the prospect of temporal advantage, Lot made the fateful decision of his life. This decision led him through a series of unfortunate experiences which imperiled his life, his soul, and his family. Leaving Abram at Bethel, Lot and his family departed eastward.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Pitched his tent toward Sodom. Desirous of settling in the immediate neighborhood of the cities of the Jordan valley, in whose wealth he hoped to share, Lot stands in marked contrast to his uncle, who remained a wanderer throughout life (see Heb. 11:9). The experience of Lot is a lesson for the Christian who is tempted to choose earthly associates and temporal gain in exchange for eternal happiness. First he “beheld,” and then he “chose.” Leaving the Jordan valley, north of the Dead Sea, he pitched his tent toward Sodom, then moved into the city (see Gen. 14:12 19:1). Though he himself was righteous, his fateful decision meant the loss of almost everything he held dear.</article>

    <shortdescription>Four kings from Mesopotamia invade Canaan and eventually carry off Lot and his family and goods. When Abraham hears this, he takes 318 men and rescues Lot and all the people and possessions are returned. He then pays tithe to Melchizedek.</shortdescription>
    <article>His trained servants. Abram is the only patriarch to appear in the role of military leader. He lost no time in making preparations to rescue his nephew, but set out in pursuit immediately, with his own retainers and those of his Amorite friends (v. 24). The Hebrew word here translated “trained servants” occurs nowhere else in the Bible, but is identified in a letter from Taanach in the 15th century b.c. as a Canaanite word meaning “retainers.” &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Born in Abram’s house, his 318 “trained servants” could be trusted. This suggests that Abram possessed more than 318 male servants, if those obtained during his recent sojourn in Egypt (ch. 12:16 16:1) are not included. How many followers and servants of Abram’s three friends followed him on his rescue mission is unknown, but they probably constituted a substantial addition to his army. The idea that Abram’s forces could defeat so powerful an enemy has often been the target of criticism. History records, however, many examples of great armies being defeated by smaller forces. Furthermore, ancient armies were very small by modern standards.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Smote them. In a false sense of security the undefeated Mesopotamian army had relaxed its vigilance. Approaching the enemy, Abram divided his forces into several groups and surprised them by a night attack. As Abram’s raiders fell upon the enemy’s camp from different directions, so much confusion resulted that the powerful Mesopotamian army fled, leaving all the spoil and captives behind.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Pursued them unto Hobah. Hobah has not been definitely identified, but Damascus lies some 40 mi. northeast of Dan. Abram pursued the fleeing enemies far enough to prevent them from regrouping their forces and turning again to attack him. His victory was complete.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
He brought back all. Though apparently possessing military genius, Abram certainly did not set out in pursuit of the professional armies of the conquering kings without first placing himself under the direction and protection of God. His fearless faith and unselfish spirit were amply rewarded. Whether Paul included Abram when he spoke of heroes of faith who “waxed valiant in fight” (Heb. 11:34) is not certain.</article>

    <shortdescription>After delivering Lot and the king of Sodom from four invading kings, Abram is met by Melchizedek, the priest-king of Salem, and gives him tithe. Salem is later the city of Jerusalem.</shortdescription>
    <article>Melchizedek. The priest-king of Salem joins the king of Sodom in welcoming Abram. In the days of Abram, Jerusalem was known as Salem, or Shalem, “peace,” or “security” (see Ps. 76:2). The city of Jerusalem is first attested in Egyptian records of the 19th century b.c., and was then ruled by Amorite kings. Jerusalem means “city of peace,” and Melchizedek, “my king is righteous” or “King of righteousness,” as the name is interpreted in, Heb. 7:2. While Sodom’s king came to meet Abram with the purpose of obtaining the release of his subjects (Gen. 14:21), Melchizedek came to bless the victorious commander.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Bread and wine. These were the chief products of Canaan. The purpose of Melchizedek’s meeting Abram with bread and wine has been the subject of much speculation. Some have thought that these were presented to Abram and his soldiers as refreshments, others consider them symbolic of the transfer of the soil of Canaan to the patriarch. Most likely they were simply a token of gratitude to Abram for recovering peace, freedom, and prosperity to the land.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The most high God. It is surprising indeed to find among the wicked Canaanites and Amorites of Abram’s time a local ruler who was not only loyal to the true god but also officiated in a priestly capacity (cf. Ex. 2:16). It shows that God still had His faithful ones scattered here and there. Although in the minority, God’s true servants had by no means vanished from the face of the earth. God has never been without faithful witnesses, however dark the period or however wicked its people.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Bible commentators have speculated much about the person of Melchizedek, a priest-king who appears suddenly in the Biblical narrative only to disappear again into the impenetrable obscurity of ancient history. Such speculation is almost entirely without value. His unexpected appearance makes him in a certain sense a timeless figure, and his priesthood a type of the priesthood of Jesus Christ.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Tithes of all. That Abram, and not Melchizedek, was the tithe payer is clearly stated in Heb. 7:4. Giving the tenth of the booty taken from the enemy was an acknowledgment of the divine priesthood of Melchizedek, and proves that Abram was well acquainted with the sacred institution of tithe paying.&lt;BR /&gt;
This is the first mention of tithing, repeatedly recognized throughout both the OT and the New Testamentas a divine requirement (see Gen. 28:22 Lev. 27:30–33 Num. 18:21–28 Neh. 13:12 Matt. 23:23 Heb. 7:8). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
That Abram paid tithe shows clearly that this institution was not later, temporary expedient to provide for the sacrificial services, but that it was a divinely instituted practice from the earliest times. By returning to God one tenth of his income the believer recognizes God’s ownership over all his property.</article>

    <shortdescription>God appears to Abram in a vision to make a covenant that he would be the father of a great nation. God tells him to count the stars. Abram believes. Then God instructs him to cut five animals in half and appears in smoke and fire with a promise.</shortdescription>
    <article>God revealed Himself to Abram in a vision. Abram was still concerned about not having a heir. So God condescended to enter into a solemn covenant with Abram, in a form customary among the ancients. The expression "to conclude" or "to make" a covenant (v. 18), literally, "to cut" a covenant, was derived from the practice here described. The animals Abram was directed to use were precisely those later prescribed as sacrificial beasts by Moses (see Ex. 29:15 Num. 15:27 19:2 Deut. 21:3 Lev. 1:14). The requirement that the quadrupeds were to be "three years old" specifies mature animals.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Each of the three animals was slaughtered and divided, and the two halves placed one against the other, with a space between. The birds were killed, but not divided. One was probably laid on one side, and the other opposite it. Those entering into the covenant were to walk between the divided pieces, symbolically vowing perpetual obedience to the provisions thus solemnly agreed upon. The lives of the animals pledged the lives of those participating in the covenant. This practice remained in force for many centuries, for we find it practiced in Jeremiah’s time (Jer. 34:18, 19).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Abram’s faith and childlike trust in God did not make him "righteous" rather, the Lord, "counted it to him for righteousness." For the first time these important concepts, faith and justification, are brought together. It is obvious that Abram had no "righteousness" until it was credited to him by God. And if he had none, no man has ever had. Abram was a sinner and needed redemption, as does every other human being but when righteousness was imputed to him, mercy and grace were also extended, effecting the pardon of his sin and bringing the rewards of righteousness. Here for the first time the full importance of faith is brought to view. Here also, for the first time, imputed righteousness is mentioned.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The final phase of the divine revelation was designed to impress Abram with the surety of God’s promises. A "smoking furnace" or "burning lamp," symbols of the divine presence, passed between the severed carcasses, as Abram himself had done earlier, by daylight. That this was not merely a vision is evident from the fact that the animals were totally consumed. By this visible token God confirmed His covenant with Abram, who thus for the first time beheld the sacred symbol of the divine presence.</article>

    <shortdescription>Sarai bore no children, so she suggests Abram take her handmaid, Hagar, as a wife, customary in those times, to bear an heir. Abram agrees and Hagar bears him a son whom he names Ishmael. The act shows a lack of faith in God's promise. He is 85.</shortdescription>
    <article>An handmaid. Notwithstanding all the promises of God, the fact remained that Abram was still without a child ten years after the first promise had been made to him (v. 3). Hagar, an Egyptian servant of Sarai, is introduced. Since the Egyptians were a powerful nation in Abram’s time, it is most singular to find an Egyptian servant in a Palestinian household. Hagar was probably the personal attendant given to Sarai when she was taken to Pharaoh (see ch. 12:15, 16). That she was still in Abram’s house tends to show that Pharaoh had not taken back the gifts he had given Abram.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Hagar. This is not an Egyptian name. Her original name is not given. The name Hagar, meaning “flight” in Arabic, may have been given to her after her flight from her mistress.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Go in unto my maid. Faithlessly concluding that there was no hope of her bearing children, Sarai decided to follow the practice of her native country in order to provide an heir for the family. The legal codes of Mesopotamia recognized the practice whereby a childless wife might give one of her slaves to her husband and obtain children by means of her, and determined precisely the rights of such offspring. Regulations were needed particularly in the case of a first wife who would bear children after the servant had done so, or when a servant would become overbearing after being honored by giving birth to an heir (see the code of Hammurabi, sections 144-146, 170, 171).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Abram hearkened. Faith may be genuine and yet prove to be weak in moments of stress and perplexity. A vigorous faith will cling to the promise, and to that alone, trusting entirely to God for its accomplishment. Such was Abram’s faith, except upon three or four brief occasions, throughout a long and eventful life. God had no need of Abram’s devices for the accomplishment of His promise. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Trust and obedience alone were required. In complying with Sarai’s rash suggestion, Abram followed in the footsteps of Adam. In both instances the result was suffering and disappointment, and the imagined blessing proved to be a curse. By listening to Sarai’s suggestion Abram created for himself difficulties far reaching in their consequences. There ensued domestic trouble and heartache, and hatred between the future offspring of both wives. Again, in the present day, how bitterly the modern representatives of Sarai’s and Hagar’s descendants, the Jews and the Arabs, have contended for the possession of the Holy Land!</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "white." He is the son of Bethuel, who was the son of Nahor, Abraham's brother. Laban lived in Haran in Mesopotamia. His sister, Rebekah, became Isaac's wife. Jacob later fled to Laban and married his daughters, Leah and Rachel.</shortdescription>
    <article>The son of Bethuel, and grandson of Abraham’s brother Nahor. He lived in Haran in Paddan-aram (Gen 24:10, 15 28:5, 10 29:4, 5). When Abraham’s servant came to Haran and asked for Laban’s sister Rebekah as a wife for Isaac, Laban and his father Bethuel consented, especially when they saw the rich presents sent by Abraham (ch 24:28–31, 50–60). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The fact that Laban is mentioned before his father (v 50) may indicate that Laban had become head of the household, possibly through incapacity on the part of his father. When Jacob was forced to flee from his brother Esau he found a refuge with his uncle Laban, who owned slaves and large flocks of sheep and goats (chs 29:16, 24, 29 31:38). Here Jacob fell in love with Rachel, the younger of Laban’s 2 daughters, but having no dowry he worked as shepherd for Laban for 7 years in order to obtain her as his wife (ch 29:15–20). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
However, Laban fraudulently tricked him into marrying her older sister Leah first, then gave him Rachel also on condition that he work another 7 years (vs 21–28). Afterward he stayed 6 years longer with Laban, and received sheep and goats in payment for his services (ch 30:25–43). When Laban and his sons became jealous because of Jacob’s rapidly increasing wealth, Jacob left his father-in-law’s house and fled toward Canaan with his family and flocks. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Laban pursued him and overtook him in Mount Gilead (ch 31:1–23). He intended to force Jacob to return to Paddan-aram, but God forbade him to punish Jacob (v 24). Hence the 2 men concluded a treaty of friendship and then parted, Jacob going on to Canaan, and Laban returning to his home in Haran (chs 31:25 to 32:1). Laban at least paid lip service to Yahweh, the God of Abraham (chs 24:50 30:27), although he worshiped other gods, for he had figurines of pagan deities (Heb. teraphîm) in his house (ch 31:30, 32–35 cf. 35:4). He also practiced divination as the Hebrew text of ch 30:27 indicates (see RSV).</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "God hears." He is Abraham's eldest son through Hagar, Sarah's handmaid. After a conflict between Isaac and Ishmael breaks out, Sarah requests Hagar and Ishmael be sent away. He also becomes the father of a great nation of Ishmaelites.</shortdescription>
    <article>Ishmael.The son born to Abram by his Egyptian slave Hagar, as the result of Sarai’s plan to obtain a child through giving her maidservant to her husband (Gen 16:1–3). This method was in harmony with Mesopotamian custom in the patriarchal age. However, it showed a lack of faith on the part of Sarai and Abram, to whom God had promised an heir (ch 15:4), and was productive of much trouble in the household (ch 16:4–9). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Abram was 86 years of age when Ishmael was born, and 11 years had passed since he had come to Canaan (chs 12:4 16:16). When Ishmael was 13 years old, the institution of circumcision was given to Abraham, and all male members of his household, including Ishmael, were circumcised (cf. chs 17:23–27). A year later Isaac was born (cf. chs 17:24 21:5). Later, because of jealousy toward Isaac, Ishmael and his mother were expelled from Abraham’s household (ch 21:10–14). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Wandering aimlessly in the southern wilderness, they almost perished of thirst, but were saved when an angel showed them a well of water (vs 15–19). Ishmael later settled in the Wilderness of Paran, which lies to the south of Palestine. He lived by his bow, and in the course of time married a girl from his mother’s homeland (vs 20, 21). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
God repeatedly promised to make Ishmael the progenitor of a great nation (chs 16:10–12 17:20 21:13, 18), which promise was later fulfilled (ch 25:12–16). See Ishmaelite. Although expelled from Abraham’s household, Ishmael seems to have maintained good relations with his relatives in Palestine, as shown by the fact that one of his daughters was later married to Esau (ch 28:9), and that he took part in the funeral rites for his father (ch 25:9). He died at the age of 137 (v 17).</article>

    <shortdescription>When Abram is 99 years old God gives him a sign of the covenant: circumcision. God changes his name to Abraham "the father of man"
 and Sarai is now Sarah and will no longer be childless. All males in Abraham's household are circumcised.</shortdescription>
    <article>And when Abram was ninety years old and nine. Thirteen years had elapsed since the birth of Ishmael (ch. 16:16) before God again revealed Himself to Abram. During the previous 11 years God had appeared to him at least 4 times (see ch. 12:1, 7 13:14 15:1). The long delay on the part of God to appear again to Abram was probably not without purpose. It was perhaps intended as a remedial penalty for Abram’s impatience in not waiting for God to work things out in His own good time and way.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Thy name shall be Abraham. Abram was the first of several men whose names God changed. Names were of much greater importance to the ancients than they are to us. All Semitic names have meanings, and usually consist of a phrase or sentence that expresses a wish, or perhaps gratitude, on the part of the parent. In view of the importance people themselves attached to names, God changed the names of certain men to make them harmonize with their experiences, past or future. Abram, meaning "exalted father," does not appear in this form elsewhere in the Bible, but is found under the form Abiram, meaning "my father is exalted" (see Num. 16:1 1 Kings 16:34). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
That the name Abraham is only an extended form of Abram, as some commentators maintain, is unlikely in view of the explanation given in this verse. With our present knowledge of the various Semitic languages current in Abraham’s time, however, it is not easy to explain the name Abraham. It is still best to take recourse to the Arabic word ruham, as several generations of Bible expositors have done. The word ruham means "great number," and may have existed in ancient Hebrew, though it does not occur in Hebrew literature available today. The name Abraham would accordingly be translated "father of a great number," which agrees with the explanation God gave to the patriarch after changing his name, "a father of many nations have I made thee."&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
I will establish my covenant. The terms and benefits of this covenant relate not only to Abraham as an individual but to all his descendants as well, both literal and spiritual. The promise here made to Abraham refers specifically to Christ (Gal. 3:16 Acts 2:30), and through Him, according to Paul, all Christians are to share in it (Gal. 3:29 Acts 16:31). A correct understanding of the terms of this covenant will go far toward maintaining a right relationship between God and the believer today.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Ye shall circumcise. From ancient times various suggestions have been made in explanation of this rite. The Alexandrian philosopher Philo, a Jew, believed it was ordained by God merely to promote physical cleanliness others saw in it a protest against certain idolatrous rites practiced by the Egyptians and other heathen nations. Calvin believed it to mean a symbolic putting away of the fifth of the flesh, and so of sin in general. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The following points, however, may be noted with reference to the importance of circumcision. It was destined: (1) to distinguish the seed of Abraham from the Gentiles (Eph. 2:11), (2) to perpetuate the memory of the Jehovah’s covenant (Gen. 17:11), (3) to foster the cultivation of moral purity (Deut. 10:16), (4) to represent righteousness by faith (Rom. 4:11), (5) to symbolize circumcision of the heart (Rom. 2:29), and (6) to foreshadow the Christian rite of baptism (Col. 2:11, 12).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "laughter." Named for the incredible joy of his parents at his birth in their old age. Isaac marries Rebekah and she bears him twins, Esau and Jacob. He also practices deception, like his father, in regard to his wife. He lived 180 years.</shortdescription>
    <article>Isaac. The son of Abraham, according to the promise (Gen 21:1–3 Gal 4:28). The name Isaac, “he laughs,” reflects his parents’ joy at the time of his birth (Gen 21:6, 7). Both Abraham and Sarah had laughed questioningly and somewhat incredulously at the promise that Sarah should have a son (chs 17:17–19 18:9–15), but with joy when the promise was fulfilled (ch 21:3, 6). From Abraham’s entrance into Palestine 25 years prior to Isaac’s birth, God had repeatedly promised him a son and heir, finally even specifying his name and the time when he would be born (ch 17:16–21). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Remaining childless at an advanced age, and not fully understanding the divine purpose, Abraham had at one time proposed adopting Eliezer, his servant, as son and heir, but God told him that the heir was to be his own son (ch 15:1–6). Soon thereafter Abraham married Hagar, Sarah’s maid, who bore him Ishmael when he had been in Canaan 11 years (ch 16:1–5, 15, 16). When, 13 years later, God announced the imminent birth of Isaac (ch 17:1–8, 15–17), Abraham interceded on behalf of Ishmael, whom he dearly loved and to whom he had looked as his son and heir (vs 18, 19). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
A year later Isaac was born, Abraham being 100 and Sarah 90 years of age (ch 17:17 cf. v 1 ch 21:5). Isaac was circumcised on the 8th day (ch 21:4), in recognition of the covenant promise (ch 17:2–17). Because of jealousies and frictions Hagar and Ishmael were expelled from the household when Isaac was weaned (ch 21:9–14). When Isaac was a young man God put Abraham to the supreme test of faith with the command to offer his son Isaac as a burnt offering (ch 22:1–14). Abraham obeyed in faith that God would raise Isaac from the dead (Heb 11:17–19), but at the last moment his hand was stayed by a voice from heaven. This test demonstrated his complete submission to God and reliance upon Him. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Three years after Sarah’s death (Gen 23:1 cf. ch 17:17), when Isaac became 40 years of age (chs 24:1–20 25:20), Abraham arranged for a wife for him—Rebekah—from among relatives in the vicinity of Haran. The old patriarch feared that intermarriage with the idolatrous Canaanites would pervert Isaac’s faith and defeat the divine purpose (ch 24). Isaac, who continued to dwell in the southland where he had been born (ch 24:62 cf. ch 20:1), appears to have been of a retiring and contemplative disposition, affectionate and indulgent (chs 24:63, 67 25:28 27:1–5, 30–40). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
With the coming of drought and famine, Isaac moved his encampment some 50 mi. (c. 80 km.) north to Gerar in the fertile plain south of Gaza (ch 26:1, 6). There God appeared to him and renewed the covenant formerly made with Abraham (vs 2–5). While sojourning at Gerar Isaac incurred the displeasure of Abimelech, a Philistine chieftain, through claiming that Rebekah was his sister, not his wife (vs 6–16). Prosperous, and the head of a large household, Isaac kept extensive flocks and herds (ch 26:13–16 cf. ch 23:6). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As a result of competition for the limited water supply of the region, Isaac dug 2 wells only to surrender them without an argument when his right to them was challenged (ch 26:17–23). He later found an adequate water supply at Beer-sheba, “the well of the oath.” Here he and the Philistine Abimelech entered into a peace pact (ch 26:23, 26–33 cf. ch 28:10), and here God again renewed the covenant promise (ch 26:24, 25).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Twenty years after their marriage, Rebekah gave birth to twins, whom they named Esau and Jacob (Gen 25:25, 26 cf. v 20). God revealed that the preeminence should go to Jacob (v 23), but Isaac favored Esau (v 28) and, in his old age, prepared to confer the birthright on him (ch 27:1–5). Taking advantage of Isaac’s advanced age and dull senses, Rebekah contrived with Jacob to trick her husband into awarding the birthright to Jacob instead (vs 6–29). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The plot was successful, but Jacob, to avoid Esau’s revenge, was forced to flee to Haran, where he sojourned for about 20 years (chs 27:46 to 28:5). Isaac died at the great age of 180 years and his sons, Jacob and Esau, buried him at Mamre, near Hebron, in the family burial place (Gen 35:27–29 49:30, 31).</article>

    <shortdescription>When Lot with his wife and two daughters escape Sodom, he loses his wife, but his two daughters escape to Zoar and dwell in a cave. The two daughters give birth through their father to the fathers of the Moabites and Ammonites.</shortdescription>
    <article>With child by their father. In this action Lot’s daughters revealed the evil influence of Sodom. They had grown to womanhood in a country where drunkenness and all forms of immorality were rampant consequently, their judgment was dull and their conscience numb. Lot had been able to protect his daughters from becoming victims of the Sodomites (see v. 8), but he had not been as successful in fixing the principles of right in their hearts. They are more to be pitied than blamed, for Lot himself shared in their sin. He was responsible for the circumstances that led up to it, as he was also for drinking the wine they set before him (see on ch. 9:21). The price Lot paid for a few years in Sodom was the loss of his entire family. The vile and idolatrous Moabites and Ammonites were his only posterity.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Moab. Ancestor of the Moabites. His name probably means “of my father,” as the LXX renders it. Although cousins of the Israelites, the Moabites were ever their enemies. Originally they inhabited the country between the Arnon and the Zered, east of the Dead Sea. From the time of David to that of Ahab they were temporarily tributary to their western neighbors, but regained independence under their king Mesha (2 Kings 3:4, 5), who extended his territory northward.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Ben-ammi. The name of the ancestor of the Ammonites probably means “son of my people.” By this his mother expressed the fact that his father and mother were of one family stock. Her son was in reality her own half brother, but his ancestors were hers as well. The Ammonites became nomads and lived in the eastern part of the region lying between the Jabbok and the Arnon. The name of their stronghold, Rabbath Ammon, is perpetuated in the name Amman, present capital of the Kingdom of Jordan.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The story of Lot and his family is tragic. A blot lies on his memory to all generations. His sin was forgiven, but the evil of years devoted to pleasure and profit lived after him for generations.</article>

    <shortdescription>Sodom and sister city Gomorrah are destroyed by fire from heaven because of the wickedness of their inhabitants. Lot's wife and two daughters barely escape, but Lot's wife looks back and becomes a pillar of salt. The Bible often alludes to Sodom.</shortdescription>
    <article>Sodom. Burning the walled, a city in the vale of Siddim (Gen. 13:10 14:1-16). The wickedness of its inhabitants brought down upon it fire from heaven, by which it was destroyed (18:16-33 19:1-29 Deut. 23:17). This city and its awful destruction are frequently alluded to in Scripture (Deut. 29:23 32:32 Isa. 1:9, 10 3:9 13:19 Jer. 23:14 Ezek. 16:46-56 Zeph. 2:9 Matt. 10:15 Rom. 9:29 2 Pet. 2:6, etc.). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
No trace of it or of the other cities of the plain has been discovered, so complete was their destruction. Just opposite the site of Zoar, on the south-west coast of the Dead Sea, is a range of low hills, forming a mass of mineral salt called Jebel Usdum, "the hill of Sodom." It has been concluded, from this and from other considerations, that the cities of the plain stood at the southern end of the Dead Sea. Others, however, with much greater probability, contend that they stood at the northern end of the sea. [in 1897].</article>

    <shortdescription>Abraham makes a feast when Isaac is weaned at probably around 3 years of age. Sarah sees Ishmael "mock" Isaac, a laughter wishing him harm, and asks Abraham to cast out Hagar and Ishmael, which he does.</shortdescription>
    <article>Some commentators translate the Hebrew word “mocking,” as “playing,” and conclude that Sarah’s declaration in the following verse was the result of jealousy. They think she could not endure the thought of Ishmael’s sharing in Abraham’s inheritance. Others explain this text in the light of Paul’s explanation that Ishmael was expelled from his father’s home for persecuting Isaac (Gal. 4:29, 30). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
According to the majority of instances in which the intensive form of this verb is used, Ishmael was “always mocking,” or taunting, Isaac. Ishmael was 14 years older than Isaac, and therefore about 17 when Isaac was weaned (see ch. 16:3 21:5). He had no doubt ever considered himself the eldest son and heir of Abraham. The birth of Isaac, however, and the weaning feast made it apparent that Sarah’s son was to replace him, and as a result his jealousy was aroused. Little wonder that Ishmael taunted Isaac on being the younger, and consequently ineligible to the rights and privileges of the birthright.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Sarah asks Abraham to "cast out this bondwoman." Sarah’s words, reflecting jealousy and contempt, hardly seem appropriate for one who had suggested Hagar’s marriage to Abraham in the first place (ch. 16:2, 3). Sarah referred to Hagar as a slave and to Ishmael as the son of a slave. Of course, Sarah had the right to demand that the status of her own son be legally clarified, that no question might arise after Abraham’s death. Sarah therefore called upon her husband to send Hagar away and to disown Ishmael.</article>

    <shortdescription>God tests Abraham's faith by calling him to offer his son as a sacrifice. "God will provide" expresses his faith in God's providence. The Lord stops Abraham and provides a ram caught in a thicket as the sacrifice.</shortdescription>
    <article>About 17 tranquil years are passed over in silence. Isaac was now a young man of 20 (see on ch. 21:14 PP 147). It was, as well, 17 years since Abraham had received his last recorded message from God. Suddenly, there came a new revelation, proposing the greatest test that could come to a human being. A vision, which came to Abraham at night was the eighth occasion on which God spoke to Abraham. Previous experiences had taught Abraham to recognize God’s voice immediately, and he was ready to answer. This brief introductory conversation consists of but two words in Hebrew, and in this respect differs from similar occasions in the past.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
God tells Abraham to take his only son to the land of Moriah and offer him as a sacrifice. If these words were spoken slowly, as is probable, Abraham must have felt, in sequence, pride, fear, and awe. Repetition was calculated by God to arouse parental affection and to prepare Abraham for the severe test soon to follow. In calling Isaac, Abraham’s “only son,” God implied that he alone was considered a legitimate heir to the promise. The sacrifice of human beings, particularly of infants, was common in ancient times. Both the Bible and archeology affirm that the Canaanites practiced such rites. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The idea of sacrificing one’s first-born to the deity was therefore nothing strange to Abraham. While God explicitly prohibited such sacrifices (Lev. 18:21), it is not certain that Abraham was clear as to this. Indeed, only on the assumption that he did not understand this divine ban can we explain his failure to protest God’s command to offer up his son.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In the supreme test of a long, eventful life Abraham obeyed without raising a single question, without offering a single objection, and without seeking human counsel. Where principle is involved, the mature Christian asks no more than a clear perception of duty. His cooperation springs from a heart overflowing with love and devotion. He lives as in the very presence of God, with no human considerations to dim his apprehension of truth and duty. Yet, upon this occasion, what a struggle must have taken place in the heart of the “friend of God,” not as to whether he would obey, but rather for divine assurance that his senses and reason were not deceiving him.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Father and son began the ascent in silence, Abraham in meditation and prayer, and Isaac pondering over his father’s unwonted reticence as to the nature and purpose of their journey. Alone with his father, solitude invited Isaac to give expression to his bewilderment over the absence of a lamb. Reaching the spot where in later centuries the Temple stood, father and son reared an altar. Salem, the city of Melchizedek, was scarcely more than a stone’s throw to the south. But a little farther, to the northwest, was the hill later known as Golgotha.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When all was complete, and nothing remained save the placing of the sacrifice upon the altar, Abraham tremblingly told Isaac all that God had revealed to him, and probably added to that his own faith in Isaac’s restoration. It is difficult to imagine the mingled feelings that must have surged through Isaac’s breast—amazement, terror, submission, and finally faith and trust. If such were the will of God, he would count it an honor to yield his life in sacrifice. A young man of 20, he might easily have resisted instead, he encouraged his father in the final moments preceding the climax. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
That Isaac understood and shared his father’s faith was a noble tribute to the careful training he had received through childhood and youth. Isaac became thus a fitting type of the Son of God, who yielded to the will of His Father (Matt. 26:39). In each case the father gave up his only son. Having laid the bound victim upon the wood, Abraham was ready for the last act, the slaying of his son and setting fire to the pile of wood. As a type of the perfect Lamb of God, Isaac offered no resistance and voiced no complaint (see Isa. 53:7).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
But the angel of the Lord stopped Abraham. The patriarch had amply demonstrated his faith and obedience and had fully satisfied the requirements of his God. Jehovah did not desire the death of Isaac in fact, He was not interested in any sacrificial offerings as such. But He has ever desired the willing obedience of His servants (1 Sam. 15:22 Hosea 6:6). So far as the will and purpose of father and son could go, the sacrifice was complete. God accepted the devotion of their hearts as a gift far more acceptable in His sight, and took the will for the deed (Heb. 11:17). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The heavenly voice also testifies to God’s rejection of human sacrifices (see Deut. 12:31 2 Kings 17:17 2 Chron. 28:3 Jer. 19:5 Eze. 16:20, 21). The assertions of Bible critics to the effect that the Hebrews, as a part of their regular order of service, practiced the rite of human sacrifice, so common among the Canaanites and other peoples of antiquity, is without foundation. &lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "yoke" or "team." She is the daughter of Bethuel and the wife of Isaac. She is found by Abraham's servant who is sent to find a wife for Isaac among his people. She exhibited some of the same deception as her brother Laban.</shortdescription>
    <article>Daughter of Bethuel, Abraham’s nephew (Gen 22:23). She lived in Paddan-aram until persuaded by Abraham’s servant, who had been sent by his master to seek a wife for Isaac, to accompany him to Canaan to become the wife of Isaac (ch 24:1–67). Finally, 20 years after her marriage, she bore twins, Esau and Jacob (ch 25:19–26). On one occasion when the family dwelt in Gerar, Isaac attempted to pass off Rebekah as his sister (ch 26:6–11), as Abraham his father had done with Sarah many years earlier (ch 12:1–20). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Rebekah favored her younger son, Jacob (ch 25:28), and directed him to deceive his blind father so as to obtain the parental blessing that Isaac planned to pronounce upon Esau (ch 27:1–29). Learning that Esau planned to kill his brother for having robbed him of his rights, Rebekah planned Jacob’s departure for Paddan-aram and assisted him in his fight (vs 41–46). She seems to have died during the 20 years of Jacob’s absence, but the circumstances of her death are not recorded. However, Jacob speaks of his mother as being buried in the Cave of Machpelah (ch 49:31).</article>

    <shortdescription>As Abraham advances in age, he asks his head servant to find a wife for Isaac among his family back in Haran. The servant is led by God and finds Rebekah who offers to water his camels. She willingly comes back with the servant and marries Isaac.</shortdescription>
    <article>Abraham seeks a wife for his son Isaac among his own people. He sends his servant, Eliezer, to find a wife in Haran. When Eliezer arrives in this land he prays for guidance and a young woman offers to water his camels. He takes this as a sign of God's leading and goes to her father's home.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
After recounting the story of his master’s prosperity, of the birth of Isaac, of his own oath to seek a wife for Isaac among his master’s relatives, and of the providential way in which he had been led to Rebekah’s home, Eliezer, with solemn earnestness, pressed for an immediate decision. In harmony with normal Oriental custom, Laban and Bethuel must approve of Rebekah’s proposed marriage to Isaac. Since the Lord had already decided the matter, however, they had no alternative but to concur. So far as they were concerned, Jehovah’s decision was not subject to further debate on their part, and Eliezer was free to take Rebekah to Canaan.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Eliezer was impatient to complete his mission by reporting its success to Abraham, lest delay should become a cause of concern to him. As might be expected, Rebekah’s relatives were disturbed at the thought of so sudden a separation from her. Their concern was for adequate time to prepare for her departure, and also that they might bid her an appropriate farewell. According to Oriental custom this would no doubt include several days of feasting and merrymaking. Eliezer’s insistence and their consideration for Rebekah led Laban to put the decision up to her. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Would she be willing to forgo the pleasure of a few more days in her girlhood home, in order to please her husband-to-be, and his father? Her ready and willing response reflects maturity of judgment, an unselfish spirit, and recognition that henceforth her first duty was to be toward her husband. Rebekah’s family invoked upon her the blessings promised by God to Abraham.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
 &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
On the return trip while Isaac is meditating in the field, the camel caravan returns and the couple meets. Rebekah was eager with anticipation to greet Isaac, but the custom of her country did not allow the groom to see his bride’s face until the marriage had been concluded (see ch. 29:23, 25). Her modesty, furthermore, was revealed in yet another way. To meet her future husband for the first time she chose to descend from the camel to the ground. Although nothing is said of Abraham, he doubtless received his daughter-in-law in the most gracious manner and with many benedictions. The account of Eliezer’s finding of Rebekah must have afforded him much satisfaction. It is easy to think of this occasion being solemnized by Abraham in a thanksgiving service.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Perhaps that same day, or the day following, Isaac led Rebekah into his mother’s tent. Empty for three years, it now became quarters for Rebekah and her maids. This implies that Rebekah took the important place of Sarah in the household of Abraham. Isaac’s marriage ceremony itself probably consisted of a simple declaration, before witnesses, of his intention to take Rebekah as his wife (cf. Ruth 4:10–13). The Bible says Isaac "loved her." Isaac had every reason to love Rebekah. She was not only most beautiful (v. 16) but of a kind, cheerful, and considerate disposition. She seems to have been, generally speaking, a paragon of feminine virtue (see Prov. 31:10–31 1 Peter 3:1–6 Titus 2:3–5). Isaac’s careful training and submissive spirit have already been noted (see on ch. 22:9). Their home must have been a very happy one.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "supplanter." He is the second of twin sons born to Isaac and Rebekah. He becomes a shepherd and deceives his father to obtain the birthright from Esau. He flees to Haran, marries Leah and Rachel, and becomes progenitor of the 12 tribes.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jacob. Isaac’s 2nd son, twin of Esau, father of the 12 patriarchs, and a progenitor of the Hebrew people. Rebekah, Isaac’s wife, bore Esau and Jacob 20 years after her marriage to Isaac. She had been childless, and Isaac had interceded with the Lord on her behalf when he was about 60 years old (Gen 25:21, 22). Prior to the birth of the twins the Lord told Rebekah that the elder should serve the younger, thus indicating that Jacob was to become inheritor of the birthright (v 23). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The name Jacob commemorates the fact that Jacob was born grasping Esau’s heel, an incident the parents noted and later seem to have taken as an omen of the destined relationship between the two brothers (Gen 25:26 27:36 Hos 12:3). While Esau took to the adventuresome life of the hunter, at which he excelled, Jacob grew up to be a “quiet man” who preferred the domestic, pastoral routine of the encampment (Gen 25:27, RSV). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Rivalry developed between the two brothers because Isaac favored Esau, his first-born, while Rebekah was partial to Jacob. Isaac seems never to have been wholly reconciled to the idea that Jacob should become his heir, as implied by the prenatal communication from the Lord to Rebekah (Gen 25:23), but apparently preferred Esau because he admired his bold, adventuresome, masculine traits. Rebekah, on the other hand, remained loyal to the prenatal admonition, doubtless also appreciating Jacob’s practical, industrious disposition (v 28).</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "hairy." He is the first born of twin sons of Rebekah and Isaac. Also called "Edom." He sells birthright to his brother for a bowl of stew. His enmity with Jacob grows after Jacob's deception. He marries Canaanite women and an Ishmaelite.</shortdescription>
    <article>The firstborn of the twin sons of Isaac (Gen 25:25). He grew up and became a hunter, endearing himself to his father with his venison, whereas his brother Jacob, as a herdsman, was his mother’s favorite. Jacob, not satisfied with being the younger son, schemed to obtain the rights belonging to the first-born, and therefore was glad when an opportunity arose to obtain the coveted birthright in exchange for a meal of red pottage. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Esau, a carefree man, did not realize in a moment of hunger what his rash action involved. For selling his birthright for a dish of red pottage, he received the nickname Edom, the “red one” (Gen 25:27–34 Heb 12:16, 17). His marriage at the age of 40 to two Hittite girls grieved his parents (Gen 26:34, 35, 36:1, 2). In order to please them in this respect he later took as an additional wife one of Ishmael’s daughters (chs 28:9 36:3).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When the time came for Isaac, who was old and almost blind, to confer upon his favored son the blessings due to the first-born, Jacob, induced by his mother, impersonated his older brother and fraudulently obtained the blessings, while Esau was out hunting (Gen 27:1–40). Highly incensed, Esau planned the murder of his brother as soon as his father had passed away, but his parents sent Jacob to Mesopotamia to escape the wrath of Esau (chs 27:41 to 28:5). When Jacob returned after 20 years, he found that Esau had forgiven him, and the two brothers met peacefully near the river Jabbok in Transjordan. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Later they were together again at the burial of their father (chs 32:3–8, 13–23 33:1–16 35:29). Esau had in the meantime made his abode in the mountainous area of Seir, which lay south of the Dead Sea, and when his descendants increased they dispossessed the inhabitants of Mount Seir and became the powerful nation of the Edomites (Gen 33:16 Deut 2:4, 12, 22). Afterward that area was also called simply the Mount of Esau (Ob 8:1, 9, 19, 21). Esau’s loss of the right of the first-born is repeatedly discussed in the Bible (Mal 1:2, 3 Rom 9:12, 13 Heb 12:17).</article>

    <shortdescription>Esau comes in weary and famished from hunting. Jacob offers him stew if Esau will "sell" his birthright. Esau agrees and makes an oath.</shortdescription>
    <article>The difference in character between the two brothers was soon apparent in a singular situation, one which proved to be a turning point in their lives. Jacob had cooked a meal of lentils (v. 34). Red lentils are to the present day a favorite food in Palestine, where they are prepared with onions, garlic, rice, and olive oil. Occasionally, meat is added also. Esau asks Jacob to "feed" him. The word translated “feed” occurs only in this passage, and means “to eat greedily” or “to devour.”&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jacob knew of the angel’s prophecy concerning himself and his brother, made prior to their birth. Now he took advantage of what appeared to him to be a fair, though unusual, opportunity. Under the Mosaic legislation the privileges of the first-born were: (1) succession to the official authority of the father, (2) the inheritance of a double portion of the father’s property, (3) the privilege of becoming the family priest (see Ex. 22:29 Num. 8:14–17 Deut. 21:17). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
To the descendants of Abraham the birthright also implied: (1) succession to the promise of the earthly Canaan and other covenant blessings, (2) the honor of being a progenitor of the promised Seed. Jacob’s proposal was unscrupulous and contemptible. It reveals, as well, a spirit of impatience, and a lack of confidence in the overruling providence of God, similar to that manifested by Abraham in his marriage to Hagar (Gen. 16:3). Jacob’s conditions of sale were exacting, selfish, and base. The theory that the end justifies the means does not have the approval of Heaven (see Matt. 4:3, 4). God could not approve the act, but He did overrule it to the eventual accomplishment of His purpose.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The KJV leaves the impression that Esau meant, “I shall die of hunger if I do not get food immediately. In that case my birthright would be of no profit to me. It is therefore better for me to get food and live on without a birthright than to die now while I am in possession of it.” Many commentators have followed this line of reasoning. Another explanation understands this expression to mean, “Earlier or later I must die anyway, and then it will not matter whether I possess the birthright or not.” &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The latter interpretation seems more plausible in the light of the words of v. 34, that he “despised his birthright.” Being indifferent about the blessings that were to be his, Esau regarded them lightly and was therefore unworthy of them. Jacob’s conduct in this transaction is difficult to defend. His attitude and words reveal premeditation. It is a dangerous and sometimes fatal mistake to anticipate and run ahead of Providence, which in due time and without human conniving will accomplish the divine purpose.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
To Esau the only thing of value was the momentary satisfaction of appetite future spiritual blessings seemed remote and unreal. In this he showed himself to be a “profane [irreligious] person” (Heb. 12:16), insensible to spiritual things. He cared for nothing but the gratification of sensual desire. Like the dumb brute, he based his decisions only on sense considerations of the moment. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The extent to which a person is willing to sacrifice present desires for future good is an accurate measure of emotional and spiritual maturity. On this basis, only the Christian can ever become fully mature, for he alone is ready and willing to forfeit all this life has to offer in order that he may be accounted worthy of the life to come (see 2 Cor. 4:17, 18 Phil. 3:7–15 Acts 20:24 Luke 20:34, 35 Heb. 11:10). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The trifling way in which Esau sold his birthright for a dish of lentils demonstrated his unfitness to become heir to the gracious promises of God. While Jacob’s conduct cannot be condoned, that of Esau is deserving of the most severe condemnation. Jacob repented and was forgiven Esau was beyond forgiveness, because his repentance consisted only of regret for the results of his rash act, not for the act itself (Heb. 12:16, 17).</article>

    <shortdescription>Because of a famine, Isaac moves to Gerar instead of Egypt and, like his father, lies about his wife. God later blesses Isaac's farming and he is asked to leave the area. This the first full story of Isaac in Genesis, his first steps of faith.</shortdescription>
    <article>When a famine came to the land, the Lord appeared to Isaac. This is the first recorded divine revelation accorded Isaac. Several promises made earlier to Abraham were now repeated to Isaac (see chs. 12:3 15:5 22:17, 18). The obedience of the father is here given as the reason for the blessings that would come upon the son. It is also an implied promise that similar action on Isaac’s part would bring similar results. James explains that Abraham’s faith, for which he was rightly praised by Paul (Rom. 4:1–5), was perfected by his obedience (James 2:21–23). Neither trust nor obedience is complete without the other. Whenever God spoke, Abraham always obeyed without delay (Gen. 12:1–4 22:1–3).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
While in Gerar, Isaac lies about Rebekah. As Abraham had declared his wife to be his sister (chs. 12:11, 12 20:2, 11), so also did Isaac but the manner in which God protected Rebekah was very different from that in which Sarah was preserved. No one so much as touched her. This experience and one other (ch. 25:28) are the only recorded instances in the life of Isaac of deviation from strict rectitude. Ashamed of his own conduct, Abraham may not have warned Isaac by a narration of his own failures in this respect. More likely, however, Abraham had told Isaac but, as so often happens, Isaac had to learn the lesson for himself through bitter experience. How often the sins of parents are perpetuated in their children! But hereditary weaknesses never free the children from personal accountability for their own mistakes. (see Eze. 18:20).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
God abundantly blessed Isaac while in Gerar. Although the patriarchs lived, generally speaking, a seminomadic life, their habits differed considerably from those of present-day Bedouins. The latter neither till the land nor own great herds and flocks as the patriarchs did. Although the Gerar valley is exceptionally fertile, a hundredfold increase in the yield of grain is about the maximum for Palestine, where it is normally thirtyfold to fiftyfold (see Matt. 13:23). The special blessing of God rested upon Isaac.</article>

    <shortdescription>When Esau is forty years old he marries two Canaanite wives, Judith and Basemath, and it grieves his parents.</shortdescription>
    <article>To Isaac’s difficulties with the Philistines a domestic cross was now added, one which caused him deep and lasting sorrow. Esau, who had already demonstrated his indifference toward religious principles, saw no reason for counseling with his parents in regard to the choice of a wife or for going to the trouble of arranging for one from among his relatives in Mesopotamia. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When he was 40 years of age, and his father 100 (ch. 25:26), he married two Hittite women, simultaneously or nearly so. In so doing he openly defied the principles of parental guidance, of nonintermarriage with the heathen, and of monogamy. The names of Esau’s wives, as well as those of their fathers, are Semitic. Judith means “the praised one,” Beeri, “my well,” Bashemath, “fragrance,” and Elon, “the strong one.” These names suggest that the two Hittite families involved must have lived in Canaan for some time and had adopted the language of the Canaanites. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
On the presence of Hittites in southern Palestine at this early period, see on ch. 20:1. These two women, as the Hebrew clearly indicates, became literally, “a bitterness of spirit” to Esau’s parents. Their perverse and evil ways, their idolatrous religion, and their unspiritual and frivolous disposition brought heartache to Isaac and Rebekah. This sad world knows no greater grief than that which children can bring.</article>

Leah was less attractive than her sister, having “tender” (Heb. rak, “weak”) eyes (Gen 29:16–26). She became the mother of 6 of Jacob’s sons, Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun, and of Dinah, a daughter (chs 31–35 30:17–21). She was buried in the family sepulcher of Machpelah (ch 49:31). In Ruth 4:11 Leah is mentioned equally with Rachel as an honored founder of Israel.</article>

Gen 28:2 29:9, 10). Jacob first met Rachel at the well near Haran upon arriving in Paddan-aram, where he had been sent to find a wife. After chivalrously rolling the stone from the well’s mouth and watering her flock (Gen 29:10), Jacob greeted Rachel with a kiss and introduced himself (vs 11, 12). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Apparently Jacob fell in love with Rachel at first sight, and his affection for her grew to be genuine and deep (v 20). Laban welcomed Jacob into his home (vs 13, 14), and after a month hired him to keep his flocks and herds (v 15 cf. ch 30:31), with the understanding that Rachel was to become Jacob’s wife in return for 7 years of service (ch 29:15–19). Since Jacob had arrived penniless, and was thus unable to pay for his intended bride, it was necessary for him to work out the stipulated price. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When the 7 years had passed, Laban surreptitiously substituted Rachel’s older sister Leah, and Jacob, the artful deceiver (ch 27), found himself deceived (ch 29:21–25). Under the pretext that custom forbade marrying off a younger daughter before her older sister, Laban proposed to Jacob that the wedding festivities already begun be continued for the nuptial week (cf. Jgs 14:12), at the close of which he would give him Rachel also, in return for another 7 years of service (Gen 29:26, 27, 30). To her great dismay and deep disappointment, “Rachel was barren” (v 31).  Leah, on the other hand, gave birth to several children (vs 32–35). Jealous of Leah, Rachel blamed Jacob for her childlessness, and petulantly demanded children of him (ch 30:1), but he reminded her that the matter was in God’s hands (v 2). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Rachel then gave Jacob her maid Bilhah as a concubine (v 3), in keeping with the ancient Oriental custom whereby a concubine’s children became the legal children of the lawful wife. Dan and Naphtali were born to this union (vs 4–8). Upon one occasion Rachel bargained with Leah for mandrakes gathered by her son Reuben (v 14), the mandrake being an herb of the belladonna family thought by people of the Near East to promote fertility. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In time “God remembered Rachel,” and she gave birth to Joseph (vs 22–24). After 20 years of service (ch 31:38) Jacob surreptitiously left Laban to return to Canaan, with his wives, flocks, and herds (vs 1–18, 20). Several years later, on a journey from Bethel, Rachel gave birth to Benjamin, but died in childbirth and was buried near Ephrath (vs 16–19), where a pillar was built to mark her grave (v 20). Jacob’s deep love for Rachel is reflected in his mention of her many years after her death (Gen 48:7).</article>

    <shortdescription>Jacob flees from Esau who intends to kill him for stealing his birthright. Isaac blesses him and then sends him to Padan Aram to find a wife. On the way Jacob has a dream of a ladder reaching to heaven. He wakes up and calls the place Bethel.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jacob steals the blessing and birthright of his brother. Esau’s despair soon changed into mortal hatred for his brother, but out of respect for his father he decided to spare him the sorrow and shame of the intended act of fratricide. Thinking that his father’s illness would end in early death, he postponed his planned act of murder. He could not know, of course, that his father would recover and live 43 years longer. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When Rebekah was informed of Esau’s intention to murder his brother, she advised Jacob to go into voluntary exile for “some days,” thinking that the vacillating disposition of Esau would bring a change of heart. Assenting to Rebekah’s proposal, Isaac took the initiative in sending Jacob to Padan-aram (see on ch. 25:20). Whether or not he knew of Esau’s plot, Isaac doubtless realized that it would be wise for Jacob and Esau to be separated until tension at home should lessen. Jacob set out in obedience to his mother’s wish and his father’s command (see Prov. 1:8). Although 77 years of age (see on Gen. 27:1), he still respected his parents and submitted to their authority.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
At the close of the second day of his journey, Jacob reached the vicinity of the city of Luz (v. 19), some 50 mi. to the north of Beersheba. He chose not to spend the night within the city itself for fear of the Canaanites. Jacob took a stone and put it “under his head” or “as a headrest.” A pillow in our sense of the word seems to have been unknown to the ancients. In many Oriental lands people used headrests made of wood, clay, stone, or metal, and still do. The stone is mentioned here in anticipation of the use made of it later on in the narrative (v. 22). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As Jacob lay there, weary, lonely, and sad, his heart turned in prayer to God. Such was the mental background of his dream. Only after two long days, during which he had opportunity to reflect upon his course of action and to realize his own helplessness, did God appear to him. In the providence of God, delay is often the means used to purify the soul and lead a man to cast himself without reserve upon God’s mercy and grace. The ladder was a visible symbol of the real and uninterrupted fellowship between God in heaven and His people upon earth. The angels ascend to present men’s needs before God, and descend with promises of divine assistance and protection. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The ladder appeared to rest upon the earth, where Jacob lay, alone, destitute, and forsaken by men. Above, in heaven, stood Jehovah. Proclaiming Himself to Jacob as the God of his fathers, He not only confirmed to him all the promises made to his fathers—the possession of Canaan, a numerous offspring, and blessing to all men—but vouchsafed to him protection on his journey and a safe return home. Since the fulfillment of this promise to Jacob was still afar off, God added the firm assurance, “I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.”&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When Jacob awakens, he concludes, "The Lord is in this place." Jacob’s statement is not evidence, as some commentators suggest, that Jacob conceived of God as appearing only at certain consecrated places, and that he had chanced upon one of these. It is, rather, an expression of his surprise and joy upon finding that whereas he had imagined himself alone, he was in reality in the very company of God. Jacob’s statement was, in a certain sense, a self-accusation. He admitted that lack of faith had occasioned his thoughts of discouragement. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It was when he felt most forsaken that he found God nearer and more real to him than ever before. The stone that had been his pillow became a monument to commemorate the revelation he had received from God. He poured oil upon it to consecrate it as a memorial to the mercy there revealed to him (see Ex. 30:26–30). This “pillar” was in no sense made an object of worship. He then called the place Bethel. By translation, “House of God.”</article>

    <shortdescription>When Esau hears Isaac's charge to not take a Canaanite for a wife and that his parents are displeased when he did so, he goes to Ishmael and takes Mahalath as a wife. She is the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son.</shortdescription>
    <article>In the blessing of Jacob by Isaac and Jacob’s commission to take a wife from among their relatives in Mesopotamia, Esau perceived the deep-rooted displeasure his parents felt toward his Hittite wives. No doubt with the intention of pleasing his parents, he went to fetch a wife from the family of his grandfather Abraham, as Jacob was instructed to do from the family of his maternal uncle, Laban. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Mahalath, or Bashemath (ch. 36:3), whom he took to wife, was related to Isaac as Jacob’s wife Rachel was to his mother Rebekah. Esau married his father’s niece Jacob, his mother’s. Esau’s going “unto Ishmael” must mean going “to the family of Ishmael,” for Ishmael died about 14 years prior to this time (see on chs. 25:19 27:1).</article>

    <shortdescription>Jacob agrees to work for seven years for Laban to receive the hand of Rachel in marriage. They seem "only a few days to him" because of how much he loves her. After seven years he requests Rachel to be his bride.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jacob, deeply in love with Rachel, was immediately ready to come to terms with his uncle. Jacob’s proposal was based partly on the fact that he was not in a position to pay the usual dowry and partly on his knowledge that the situation at home would make necessary a rather prolonged stay with Laban. Laban’s assent is to be explained solely on the ground of greed, which became more apparent as time went on. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jacob gave evidence of his devoted affection for Rachel, not alone by his willingness to serve seven years for her, but even more by the spirit in which he worked for his avaricious uncle. Many as were the days that must pass before Rachel should become his bride, they were rendered happy by his love for her. The words used by Moses to express the depth of Jacob’s love breathe pure affection and tender devotion.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jacob desires Rachel in marriage and works for Laban for seven years, after which Laban deceives Jacob and gives him Leah, his eldest daughter. Jacob is angry and demands Rachel, whom he receives after agreeing to work another seven years.</shortdescription>
    <article>It is an interesting comment on Laban that Jacob found it necessary to remind him of the expiration of the seven years. A great marriage feast, probably lasting an entire week (v. 27), was prepared, according to the usual custom. Laban’s deception of Jacob was possible because of the custom of veiling the bride and bringing her to the bridegroom “in the evening.” &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Although girls usually had little choice in the selection of their husbands, Leah’s consent was necessary to the success of this base proposal. She must herself have loved Jacob, to approve and cooperate in the plan to wrong both her sister and her future husband by marrying one who neither sought nor loved her. Laban’s duplicity resulted in lifelong rivalry between the two sisters (see ch. 30:14–16).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Next morning Jacob, the master deceiver, awoke to find himself the victim of deceit. Inexorable justice had repaid him double for his double-dealing. In self-defense Laban pleaded an imaginary requirement of local social custom. Had this actually been the custom in Haran, as it was in some other ancient countries, he should have told Jacob of it when the latter proposed working for Rachel. Jacob’s vow to God at Bethel, however, and his longing for Rachel led him to stay by Laban rather than repudiate the marriage as he might have done.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It is plain that Jacob did not serve another seven years before Rachel became his wife. This occurred at the close of Leah’s festal week. Jacob’s act of bigamy must not be judged by a later provision in the Mosaic law that prohibited marriage with two sisters concurrently (Lev. 18:18). At the same time Jacob’s double marriage cannot be justified on the ground that the blessing of God eventually made it the means of multiplying Jacob’s seed and so fulfilling His promise. God simply overruled the errors of men even these could not thwart His purpose (see Ps. 76:10). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The bigamy that had been occasioned by Laban’s deception and Jacob’s affection brought friction and regret to the homes of both men. In this school of affliction Jacob learned that “the way of transgressors is hard” (Prov. 13:15). The jealousy and misery attending this marriage are a commentary on Moses’ specific injunction against a man’s marrying two sisters concurrently (Lev. 18:18).</article>

    <article>The eldest son of Jacob and Leah (Gen 29:31, 32 Gen 35:23 Gen 46:8 1 Chr 2:1 1 Chr 5:1). As to his life history, he is mentioned first as finding mandrakes in the field, which Rachel desired (Gen 30:14) next for his immorality with Bilhah (ch 35:22) for which he later lost his father’s blessings that would have been due him as the first-born (ch 49:3, 4) third, for his attempt to save Joseph from his murderous brothers by inducing them to throw him into a cistern instead (ch 37:21–29). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Although he did not betray his brothers to their father, he was not a partner in their plot against Joseph (ch 42:22). Later, when Jacob feared to send Benjamin to Egypt, Reuben offered 2 of his own sons as guarantees for Benjamin’s safety (v 37). On his deathbed Jacob expressed the disappointment that his first-born son’s conduct had caused him, and described his character as being unstable as water (ch 49:3, 4). Reuben’s sons were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi (Gen 46:8, 9 Ex 6:14 1 Chr 5:3).</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "attached." He is the third son of Jacob and Leah. His name comes from Leah's desire for Jacob to be attached to her. Levi and Simeon are known for avenging their sister Dinah. He is also passed by to receive the blessing of his father.</shortdescription>
    <article>The third son of Jacob by Leah (Gen 29:34). The only recorded event of Levi’s life is his participation in the massacre of Hamor, Shechem, and the rest of the male population of the city of Shechem, in retaliation for Shechem’s humiliation of Dinah, Levi’s sister (ch 34:25–31). This criminal act of Levi and his full brother Simeon was remembered by Jacob on his deathbed, and his strong disapproval was probably the reason why he passed by these two brothers and gave the blessing of the first-born, which had been forfeited by Reuben, to Judah, the fourth son (ch 29:35). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Levi had three sons, Gershon (sometimes spelled Gershom), Kohath, and Merari (ch 46:11). He died at the age of 137 years (Ex 6:16). He became the ancestor of the tribe of the *Levites, who were chosen to serve in the sanctuary.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "judge" or "God has judged." He is the fifth son of Jacob through Bilhah, Rachel's maid. Jacob blesses him by saying, "Dan shall judge his people." His tribe is the last to receive their inheritance in the promised land.</shortdescription>
    <article>The fifth son of Jacob. His mother was Bilhah, Rachel's maid (Gen 30:6, “God hath judged me”, Heb. dananni). The blessing pronounced on him by his father was, “Dan shall judge his people” (Gen 49:16), probably in allusion to the judgeship of Samson, who was of the tribe of Dan.&lt;BR /&gt;
The tribe of Dan had their place in the march through the wilderness on the north side of the tabernacle (Num 2:25, Num 2:31; Num 10:25). It was the last of the tribes to receive a portion in the Land of Promise. Its position and extent are described in Jos 19:40-48.&lt;BR /&gt;
The territory of Dan extended from the west of that of Ephraim and Benjamin to the sea.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "praise." The fourth son of Jacob and Leah, his name originates with Leah's words after his birth, "Now I will praise the Lord." Judah intercedes for Joseph so his life is spared. He receives the first-born blessing from Jacob.</shortdescription>
    <article>The fourth son of Jacob by his wife Leah (Gen 29:32–35). He married a Canaanite girl, Shua, with whom he had become acquainted through a Canaanite friend (ch 38:1, 2). She bore him three sons, Er, Onan, and Shelah (vs 3–5). As wife for his son Er he took Tamar, another Canaanite girl (v 6). When Er died childless, Judah gave Tamar to Onan, in harmony with custom of the time (vs 7, 8). When Onan died without leaving an heir (vs 9, 10), Tamar went back to her father’s house, having Judah’s promise, however, that she would be given to Shelah as soon as he reached the age of maturity (v 11). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When Judah failed to keep his word Tamar obtained offspring by deception from Judah himself, and bore him two sons, Perez and Zerah (vs 12–30). Although Judah is revealed to have been morally aberrant in certain respects, yet in many other ways his character seems to have been more exemplary than that of his brothers. He did not take part in Simeon and Levi’s massacre of Shechem (ch 34), and it was he who, in an attempt to save Joseph, proposed to his brothers that Joseph be sold rather than murdered (ch 37:26–28). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Later, in Egypt, he showed much nobility of character when Joseph, unrecognized by his brothers, wanted to detain Benjamin for having allegedly stolen a silver cup. Judah eloquently pleaded on behalf of his younger brother, and offered himself as prisoner to Joseph to obtain Benjamin’s release (Gen 44). When Jacob and his family migrated to Egypt Judah was chosen to precede the company and announce Jacob’s arrival to Joseph (ch 46:28). When Jacob blessed his sons upon his deathbed, he gave Judah the blessings due the first-born (ch 49:8–12), passing over Reuben for his sin of incest (v 4), and Simeon and Levi, because of their murder of the Shechemites (vs 5–7). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The prophecies pronounced at that time were later fulfilled. The tribe of Judah became the most important of the tribes of Israel, and Perez (KJV “Pharez”), one of Judah’s sons, became the ancestor of David and of the royal house of the southern kingdom (Ruth 4:18–22 1 Chr 2:3–15 3:1–6) and of the Lord Jesus, the Saviour of mankind (Mt 1:3–16).</article>

    <shortdescription>Laban deceives Jacob and gives his oldest daughter, Leah, to him in marriage. Jacob demands Rachel and after receiving her as his wife he serves Laban another seven years. Marrying two sisters creates family conflicts for Jacob.</shortdescription>
    <article>It is plain that Jacob did not serve another seven years before Rachel became his wife. This occurred at the close of Leah’s festal week. Jacob’s act of bigamy must not be judged by a later provision in the Mosaic law that prohibited marriage with two sisters concurrently (Lev. 18:18). At the same time Jacob’s double marriage cannot be justified on the ground that the blessing of God eventually made it the means of multiplying Jacob’s seed and so fulfilling His promise. God simply overruled the errors of men even these could not thwart His purpose (see Ps. 76:10). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The bigamy that had been occasioned by Laban’s deception and Jacob’s affection brought friction and regret to the homes of both men. In this school of affliction Jacob learned that “the way of transgressors is hard” (Prov. 13:15). The jealousy and misery attending this marriage are a commentary on Moses’ specific injunction against a man’s marrying two sisters concurrently (Lev. 18:18).</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "add" or "increase." The oldest of two sons of Jacob by Rachel. Jacob favored Joseph, the son of "his old age" and it created jealousies among his brothers who sought to kill him, but sold him into slavery. He became a prince in Egypt.</shortdescription>
    <article>The son of Jacob, born to his beloved wife Rachel after a long period of barrenness. At his birth his father Jacob had served Laban 14 years, hence was 91 years old (cf. Gen 41:46 45:6 47:9) this was 6 years before the family returned to Canaan (chs 30:22–26 31:41). Because Joseph was the first-born son of his favored wife, Jacob showed favoritism to the boy, especially after Rachel’s death. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
He demonstrated this attitude by providing Joseph with an expensive garment, such as was worn by noble youths (ch 37:3). The jealousy created by this was increased when Joseph told his brothers two dreams in which he had seen all the members of his family, including his parents, doing obeisance to him (vs 4–11). When he was 17 years of age his father sent him to Shechem to visit his brothers, who were pasturing the family’s flocks there. Reaching Shechem he found that they had passed on to Dothan, so he sought them there. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As soon as they saw him they conspired to kill him, but Reuben, hoping to save him, persuaded the others to throw him into an empty cistern instead. However, when in Reuben’s absence a caravan of Ishmaelites and Midianites came along, traveling to Egypt, the other brothers sold him to these traders as a slave. To deceive their father they stained Joseph’s garment with the blood of a goat killed for that purpose, and took the bloodstained coat to their father, saying that they had found it. Jacob concluded that Joseph had been torn to pieces by a wild animal (vs 12–33). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
After being sold to Egyptian traders and sent to Egypt, Joseph worked for Potiphar before being thrown in prison and then raised to power. Joseph’s two sons became the ancestors of two large and important tribes, Ephraim and Manasseh, but the name Joseph is frequently used in the OT to denote the combined tribes or the northern kingdom as a whole (Jos 16:1, 4 Jgs 1:22 1 Ki 11:28 Ps 78:67 Eze 37:16 etc.).</article>

    <shortdescription>Jacob agrees to work seven more years in order to receive Rachel after being deceived by Laban. When Jacob seeks to leave the country, Laban is fickle. Jacob flees and Laban pursues him. They finally part after making a covenant.</shortdescription>
    <article>Laban is reluctant to let Jacob go, so Jacob flees with his family and flocks. Since Laban received word two or three days after Jacob’s flight (v. 22), and overtook him after a pursuit of seven days, it appears that the two met nine or ten days after Jacob’s departure from the vicinity of Haran. The mountains of Gilead lie more than 275 mi. from Haran, a distance that can be covered by fast camels in 7 days, the time required by Laban. But it would be impossible to drive the flocks and herds such a distance in that length of time, since they could cover no more than 9 or 10 mi. a day. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Apparently Laban did not pursue the fugitives immediately upon receiving word of their flight. He knew that Jacob could make but slow progress (ch. 33:13, 14), and that he himself need therefore be in no haste. Since Rachel had taken her father’s household gods, her departure must have been from Haran, where her father’s home was situated (ch. 29:4, 5). The fact that Laban knew his idols had been stolen suggests that he must have returned home before pursuing Jacob. He may have finished the shearing of his sheep, concluded the accompanying festivities, and arranged for the care of the flocks Jacob had forsaken before leaving Haran. The time that elapsed between his receiving word of Jacob’s flight and his own departure may easily have been 30 days or more.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Overtaking Jacob, Laban assumed the role of a good-natured but grievously wronged and deeply hurt father. Did Jacob not realize how easily Laban could compel him to return to Haran? That Laban was talking with him at all instead of treating him as he presumably deserved, Jacob owed solely to the intervention of the God of his fathers the previous night. But why should Jacob’s ardent longing to return to his father lead him to steal his father-in-law’s gods? This was Laban’s only legitimate complaint, a polished shaft aimed to hit hard and well. After making a covenant, they part their ways. It does not appear that Laban kissed Jacob on taking his final leave, as he had done upon meeting him the first time (ch. 29:13). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Though Laban and Jacob parted reconciled to each other, and not as enemies, they were not exactly the best of friends. Laban blessed them. Laban, whose better nature appears to have prevailed as a result of the covenant, or perhaps of the feast, or of the contemplated parting with his daughters, poured out his feelings in a farewell blessing upon them. Thus Laban disappears from the Scripture narrative. With this, all contact between the family in Canaan and relatives in Mesopotamia ceases.</article>

    <shortdescription>While preparing to meet his brother Esau, Jacob spends a night alone and wrestles with God (Hosea 12:4 says "Angel"). The "deceiver" struggles and becomes the "overcomer." God changes his name to Israel and blesses Jacob who now goes to meet Esau.</shortdescription>
    <article>Earlier in the day Jacob had sent forward his gift to Esau. As night drew on he sent all that he had, family and possessions, over the Jabbok, desiring to spend the night alone in prayer. The Jabbok, today called Nahr ez–Zerqa, “the blue river,” is an eastern tributary of the Jordan. Flowing through a deep canyon, it enters the larger stream some 25 mi. north of the Dead Sea. Jacob had remained on the northern bank of the river in order that he might be alone to seek God in prayer. In the present situation his usual cleverness was of no avail. God alone could be of help to mitigate Esau’s anger and to save Jacob and his family. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
That Jacob’s antagonist was neither a human being nor an ordinary angel is to be inferred from the fact that Jacob spoke of Him as God (v. 30). The prophet Hosea also refers to Him both as God and as an Angel (Hosea 12:3, 4). This celestial visitor was none other than Christ. Such an appearance of Christ in human form is neither strange nor unique (Gen. 18:1). The unknown wrestler used only the strength of a human being in his struggle with Jacob. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Thinking his assailant a mortal enemy, Jacob fought as if for his life. But, as dawn approached, a single touch of more than human strength sufficed to cripple Jacob, and he became aware of the fact that his antagonist was more than human. The Angel sought to withdraw before daybreak, but gave no reason for wishing to do so. Commentators have suggested a desire on His part either to prevent others from witnessing the scene or perhaps to prevent Jacob from seeing Him. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The crippling touch and the divine voice had convinced Jacob that the One with whom he had thus wrestled for hours was a messenger from heaven. Having for hours sought desperately for divine help, Jacob felt he could not afford to let Him go without first receiving assurance of the pardon and protection for which he longed. This he asked as an outright gift, realizing that he had nothing to offer God in return. He proposed no bargain his desperate situation was his only plea. Whereas in the past he had relied upon his own wisdom and strength, he had now learned to trust wholly in God.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The great spiritual change that had come over Jacob was now symbolized by a change of name from Jacob to Israel indicating the nature of his new relationship to God. The names of Abram and Sarai had likewise been changed (see ch. 17:5, 15) and from that time forward the Scriptures always call them by their new names. But in the subsequent history of Jacob his old and new names are used more or less interchangeably. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jacob’s new name, Israel, became the name of the nation that sprang from his body. For him, the change of name, like his change of character, was far more significant than that of his grandparents. It represented his transformation from a “deceiver” of men to a “victor of God.” The new name, ostensibly a token of physical victory, was to be a perpetual reminder of the completed spiritual renovation that had taken place.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jacob's daughter, Dinah, is raped by Shechem who wants her as a wife. After Shechem and Hamor, his father, agree to have all their men circumcised, Simeon and Levi slaughter all the males in their city and bring back Dinah. Jacob is very displeased.</shortdescription>
    <article>Dinah, as yet the only daughter of Jacob could not have been more than five or six years old when the family left Haran, since she was not born until after Leah’s sixth son (ch. 30:21). She had possibly reached the age of 14 or 15 when the sordid event described in this chapter took place. It is apparent, therefore, that some eight or more years had passed since Jacob’s return to Canaan (see ch. 33:17). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
If the events narrated in chapters 34 to 37 are presented in chronological order, as they seem to be, Dinah cannot have been much older than 15 at the time, because Joseph, who was about the same age as Dinah (ch. 30:21–24), was only 17 when sold into slavery by his brothers (ch. 37:2). The fact that she went out unaccompanied would seem to indicate that she was still regarded at home as a child. While at this event, Shechem approaches her. From what we know of Canaanite morals, Shechem’s conduct was by no means unusual, and Dinah paid in full the penalty for her unwise independence in associating with wordly youth.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Information concerning Dinah’s experience must have reached her father indirectly, since she herself remained in Shechem’s house (v. 26). Jacob’s silence was probably due to a combination of sorrow, caution, and perplexity. He had learned to be prudent rather than to act upon impulse. The seriousness of the predicament was certain to affect the interests of the entire household, and called for united counsel and decision. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
To refuse the marriage proposal would be to incur the ill will of the Shechemites to accept it would be an open violation of the principle of non association with the heathen (see chs. 24:3, 6 26:35). Yet Dinah was with Shechem, and how was he to secure her return? Had Jacob foreseen the tragic course of action some of his sons were to pursue upon learning of the affair, he would probably have taken things into his own hands and acted at once. As it was, however, he did better in thus “ruling his spirit” than did his sons when they took the city (Prov. 16:32).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Hamor, Shechem's father, proposed a policy of intermarriage between Jacob’s family and the Shechemites. Attractive as the offers of the prince of Shechem were, they were declined by Jacob’s sons, who now took the initiative in discussing their sister’s proposed marriage (see ch. 24:50). To accept the proposals would have been to violate the sacred principles of their call as a family and to sacrifice the promises of God for wordly gain. Their rejection of Hamor’s proposal was right, to be sure, but their procedure was just as certainly wrong. In plotting murder under the protecting cloak of religious scruples, Jacob’s sons were guilty of hypocrisy and cruelty. Their hypocrisy consisted in professing to accept the proposition of Hamor when they had no intention of doing so, on condition that the Shechemites accept the seal of God’s holy covenant. They knew that if the Shechemites should submit to circumcision it would be a mere form on their part. Their proposal was, finally, conceived in a spirit of cruel revenge.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Inflammation and fever usually set in on the third day. While the Shechemites were thus helpless, two of Dinah’s older brothers set about their bloody work of revenge. This cruel massacre demonstrates how one sin leads on to another, like flames of fire spreading in a dry thicket (Isa. 9:18). Dissipation led to seduction, and seduction to revenge and murder (see James 1:15). The disgrace that had been brought upon one family made widows and orphans of the women and children of an entire city. Indirectly, this narrative testifies to the reliability of Moses as a historian. Himself a Levite, he does not spare the character of his progenitor.</article>

    <article>The youngest of Jacob’s twelve sons, who was born to Rachel on the road from Bethel to Ephrath. His dying mother called him Ben-oni, “son of my sorrow,” but his father gave him the name Benjamin (Gen 35:16–19). It was with great reluctance that Jacob allowed Benjamin to go to Egypt on the second journey of his sons to that country to purchase food during the famine. Joseph also deeply loved Benjamin (chs 43:29 to 44:34). The blessing of Jacob for Benjamin is recorded in ch 49:27. Benjamin had numerous descendants (Gen 46:21 Num 26:38–41 1 Chr 7:6–12 1 Chr 8:1–40).</article>

    <shortdescription>Reuben lays with his father's concubine Bilhah, perhaps to assert his leadership role as first-born or perhaps in anger at his father for not loving Leah, his mother. He later loses Jacob's blessing which would have gone to him as the first-born son.</shortdescription>
    <article>Since Bilhah was the wife of Reuben’s father, this was an act of incest. Under Mosaic law it was punishable by death (Lev. 18:8), and was greatly despised even by pagans (1 Cor. 5:1). Though Bilhah may not have been entirely innocent, Reuben was certainly guilty of a most heinous moral lapse. Following these words ("Israel heard of it") the Hebrew text has a gap which led the ancient Jewish rabbis to comment, “There is a hiatus in the verse.” The LXX fills in the gap by adding, “and it appeared evil in his sight.” &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This would seem to represent but inadequately the mingled shame and sorrow, indignation and horror, with which the wickedness of Jacob’s eldest son must have filled him. More bitter and crushing was this last blow than even the death of Rachel or the ravishment of Dinah. Jacob’s silence may be interpreted as the silence of devout resignation. But when the time came to pronounce a blessing on his sons, the dying Jacob felt that Reuben had by his crime forfeited the birthright, his position of temporal and spiritual leadership in the family (Gen. 49:4 1 Chron. 5:1). The first was given to Judah, the second to Levi.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jacob travels to Hebron to see his father, Isaac, who dies at the age of 180 years. Jacob and Esau bury their father.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jacob’s arrival at Mamre constituted the formal return to his father’s house, where he now took up his abode as Isaac’s heir. Mamre was in the immediate vicinity of Hebron, formerly Kirjath-arba (see chs. 13:18 23:2). Isaac lived 23 years after Jacob’s departure from Haran. Jacob was 120 at the death of his father (ch. 25:26). Ten years later, at the age of 130 years, he stood before Pharaoh (ch. 47:9). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
At that time Joseph had been governor of Egypt for nine years (ch. 45:11). Jacob was therefore 121 years old when Joseph was promoted at the age of 30 (ch. 41:46), and 108 when Joseph was sold at the age of 17 (ch. 37:2). Consequently, Isaac was 168 years of age when Joseph was sold into slavery. Since this tragic event occurred while Jacob was living at Hebron with his aged father (ch. 37:14), Isaac witnessed the grief of Jacob and survived that event for a period of 12 years.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When Isaac died, Esau and Jacob had been fully reconciled for about 23 years. It is not strange therefore to find Esau joining Jacob in the last rites for their honored father. Under similar circumstances Isaac and Ishmael had cooperated in the burial of Abraham (ch. 25:9). Isaac was pious and humbly submissive before God, amiable and generous toward his fellow men. In comparison with that of his son Jacob, his own character was by far the more excellent.</article>

    <shortdescription>Joseph, the favored son of Jacob, is despised by his half-brothers. When he shares two dreams with them indicating he will rule over them, his father rebukes him and his brothers envy him, but Jacob keeps the incident in mind.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jacob found particular satisfaction in the companionship of Joseph, whose amiability and ideals made him so different from his brothers. Since Jacob had been 91 years old at the birth of Joseph, and Benjamin was not born till a number of years later, he considered Joseph “the son of his old age.” Jacob’s preferential treatment of Joseph reached a climax in the special coat, or tunic, he made for him. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jacob’s fondness for Joseph was natural, perhaps, since he saw in him not only the child of his beloved Rachel but also an excellence of character which stood in marked contrast to the notorious lives of some of his other sons. When Joseph had a dream and shared it, they hated him, not only because of the dream, but also for his boldness in telling them about it (v. 8). If Joseph’s first dream had pointed only to supremacy over his brothers, the second extended it to the entire family. That Joseph should have related this dream to his brothers, after seeing how they had reacted to the first one, reveals a decided immaturity of judgment. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This dream could only intensify their envy and hatred. Joseph, however, seems to have felt a certain satisfaction in telling his dreams and watching his brothers’ envy and anger. Jacob, who was present upon this occasion, administered him a sharp rebuke, partly, perhaps, in surprise, and partly to disavow any collusion on his own part. Though Jacob disapproved of the narration of the dream, he could not avoid being impressed by the way in which it reflected his own thoughts. Some have questioned the divine origin of the second dream, inasmuch as it seems to have met but partial fulfillment. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Neither Rachel nor Leah lived to see the rulership of Joseph’s in Egypt (chs. 35:19 49:31). It is sufficient to note that even Jacob did not take every detail of the dream thus literally, since Joseph’s mother was already dead at the time (v. 10). Jacob apparently understood the dream as representative of Joseph’s supremacy in a general sense.</article>

    <shortdescription>Joseph goes to check on his brothers who are tending their father's sheep. They see him coming and plot to kill him. Reuben intercedes and Joseph is cast into a pit and sold as a slave to Midianite traders. Jacob is told wild animals killed Joseph.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jacob was apparently unaware of how keenly his sons hated Joseph, a fact they had been at pains to hide from him. This is evident not only from the fact that he sent Joseph alone to visit them but also from his reaction to their story of this disappearance. He seems never for a moment to have suspected foul play on their part. Jacob’s concern for his sons was probably due not alone to their long absence but also to fear that fellow countrymen of the Shechemites may have either taken revenge for the massacre or hindered them in the pasturing of their flocks.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When Joseph's brothers saw him coming, they plotted to kill him. To men who had slain the males of a whole city, the murder of a single individual could hardly seem a grievous sin. Hatred had developed in their hearts to the point that they were ready to kill their own brother in cold blood. They were far from home and its restraining influences. The “pit” into which they intended to cast his body was one of the cisterns common in Palestine. The story they proposed to tell their father would be entirely credible, for Palestine was a wild country during the second millennium b.c., and lions, bears, and other animals roamed at will (see Judges 14:5 1 Sam. 17:34).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Though Reuben had been far from perfect himself (see ch. 35:22), his heart was not so hard as theirs. As the eldest son, he felt a special responsibility for his younger brother, and determined, if possible, to save him from them. The would-be murderers were content, for the moment, to follow Reuben’s suggestion. Weak and vacillating though he was (ch. 49:4), Reuben appears to have been the only one of Joseph’s brothers in whom the natural affection of a brother was not completely lost. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Though he lacked the courage to resist openly their stronger wills, he at least made a timid attempt to save Joseph’s life. Reuben’s plan was commendable as far as it went, but it failed because of his lack of determination and vigilance. Adding insult to injury, they stripped Joseph and threw him into a dry cistern nearby. It seems that cistern were often put to such a use (see Jer. 38:6). The thought that he would die a painful death by starvation apparently satisfied their vindictiveness, and they paid no heed to his piteous appeals (ch. 42:21, 22).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Judah saw in the appearance of the Ishmaelite caravan a means for permanently disposing of Joseph without taking his life. This would effectively eliminate him from further competition in the contest for the birthright. The brothers reasoned, no doubt, that Joseph had done little to increase the family fortune, and they saw no reason why he should fall heir to the wealth their hands had produced. Judah’s proposal proved to be a most welcome one to all the brothers, who by now, after reflecting upon their original impulse to kill Joseph, found themselves somewhat reluctant to lay their own hands upon him.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The selling of Joseph was an overt violation of the principle that no man has the right to subject another to involuntary servitude (cf. Lev. 25:39–43). It demonstrates clearly the extent of moral perversion that had taken place in the hearts of Joseph’s brothers. Those who sold Joseph demonstrated thereby that they had utterly lost all natural affection. Joseph’s sale into slavery is the first recorded example in the Bible of such a transaction.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Though Reuben was beside himself with grief and perplexity, his ruthless and unrelenting brothers were at no loss for a plan. Apparently, however, they had neither the brazen boldness to carry through their scheme in person nor the courage to witness their father’s first outburst of grief. Hence they arranged for another, probably a slave, who knew nothing more of the matter than what he was told, and so could not reveal their dark secret, to carry the bloody coat to Jacob in Hebron.&lt;BR /&gt;
Convinced of Joseph’s death by the undeniable evidence presented, Jacob entered upon a period of mourning, according to the custom of ancient times.</article>

    <shortdescription>Judah leaves his brothers and marries a Canaanite woman named Shua. She bears him three sons, Er, Onan, and Shelah. Judah is moving away from God's plan to bless the children of Jacob as God's special people.</shortdescription>
    <article>Genesis 38 gives the origin of the three leading families of Judah, the future princely tribe of Israel. It shows also that the sons of Jacob, forgetting the sacred vocation of their race, were in danger of perishing in the sins of Canaan. Had not God in mercy interposed to bring about the removal of the whole house of Jacob to Egypt, the chosen race might have succumbed to the corrupting influence of Canaanite customs. Thus, ch. 38 is an integral part of the early history of Israel.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Being the fourth son of Leah, Judah was certainly not more than 3 years or so older than Joseph, which would make him about 20 years old at the time Joseph was sold (see ch. 37:2 and on ch. 30:24). Between Joseph’s sale as a slave and Jacob’s migration to Egypt lay 22 years (cf. chs. 41:46 45:6), so that Judah was about 42 years old when the family moved to Egypt. At that time he not only had the three sons, mentioned in ch. 38, but was apparently a grandfather as well, as ch. 46:12 seems to imply. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
If this be correct, his sons Er, Onan, and Shelah must have been born before Joseph was sold, since they themselves had already reached marriageable ages when the events involving Tamar occurred, and Tamar’s son Pharez had two sons of his own when the family moved to Egypt. These observations oblige us to conclude that some of Jacob’s sons must have married while very young. Judah could not have been more than 14 years old at the birth of his oldest son, Er, nor Er more than 13 at his marriage to Tamar. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The birth of Judah’s twin sons by his daughter-in-law Tamar must have taken place within two years after Er’s death. Pharez cannot have been more than 14 years old when Hezron and Hamul were born, apparently also as twins, before the departure from Canaan. Such early marriages are by no means uncommon in certain parts of the Orient even today. In the case of Jacob’s family, they may represent Canaanite influence. The considerations make it virtually certain that Judah was a married man and a father at the time of Joseph’s sale, and that part of the narrative of ch. 38 had already taken place.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
For some unknown reason Judah visited Adullam while he was still a youth. Perhaps it was while feeding the flocks of his father in that vicinity that he accidentally made the acquaintance of the Adullamite and remained for a time with him. That Judah did not separate himself permanently from his parental home is clear from the fact that he was with his brothers when Joseph was sold (ch. 37:26), and also when the famine forced them to buy grain in Egypt (ch. 43:3).</article>

    <shortdescription>Potiphar buys Joseph as a servant. Potiphar's wife tries to seduce Joseph to sleep with her. He refuses. When no men are in the house, she grabs his coat and says, "Sleep with me." He runs from the house leaving his coat. Joseph is put in prison.</shortdescription>
    <article>In this moment of crisis the personal integrity of Joseph stands forth in sharp contrast to that of his brothers. What would Reuben (ch. 35:22) or Judah (ch. 38:16) have done under the circumstances? Little wonder that Jacob favored Joseph, and that Potiphar felt such confidence in him. This confidence in him reinforced his serene purpose to be true to God, and made even more desirable to him his lofty ideals of personal honor and integrity. Joseph’s character stood firm under persistent attack. Wisely, he refused even to be in her company. In thus refusing, Joseph revealed sincerity, wisdom, and determination in the way of right. The stronger the temptation, the more resolute he became in resisting it.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In repeating her tale to her husband, Potiphar’s wife indirectly blamed him for the supposed affront by referring to Joseph as “the Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us” (v. 17). Potiphar’s action in confining Joseph with political offenders may be considered extreme leniency in view of punishment customarily administered for the crime of which he stood accused. In later times the penalty for an attempt at adultery was a thousand blows upon the soles of the feet, and for the rape of a freewoman it was even more severe (Diodorus i. 78). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Potiphar’s lenience no doubt reflected his confidence in Joseph’s integrity, and in contrast, very little respect for his wife’s account of the episode. Nevertheless Joseph’s punishment seems to have been severe at first, for more happened to him than the Genesis narrative implies. According to Ps. 105:18, his “feet” were “hurt with fetters,” and “he was laid in iron.”&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
There is an Egyptian papyrus, now in the British Museum, that relates a “story of the two brothers” superficially resembling the story of Joseph and Potiphar’s wife. Numerous scholars have taken it to be the original of the story of Joseph’s experience, and although the two are similar in some respects, the differences far outweigh the similarities. The Egyptian story, furthermore, has a mythological setting, and is of later origin than the book of Genesis by at least 250 years.</article>

    <shortdescription>Potiphar's wife accuses Joseph of raping her. Potiphar listens to the story and is angry and throws Joseph into prison where the king's prisoners are confined. But God is with Joseph and shows him mercy.</shortdescription>
    <article>In repeating her tale to her husband, Potiphar’s wife indirectly blamed him for the supposed affront by referring to Joseph as “the Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us” (v. 17). Potiphar’s action in confining Joseph with political offenders may be considered extreme leniency in view of punishment customarily administered for the crime of which he stood accused. In later times the penalty for an attempt at adultery was a thousand blows upon the soles of the feet, and for the rape of a freewoman it was even more severe (Diodorus i. 78). &lt;BR /&gt;

According to Ps. 105:18, his “feet” were “hurt with fetters,” and “he was laid in iron.”&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The same Providence that had attended Joseph in the house of Potiphar followed him to prison and brought comfort to him in his new affliction. Moses attributes the speedy favor he found in the sight of the keeper to the help of God. The irksomeness of his confinement must have been mitigated considerably by the jailer’s growing trust and confidence in him, since the blessing of the Lord attended all things committed to his care. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Although Joseph had been treated unjustly, he made the best of the circumstances in which he found himself. By discharging his duties in a cheerful, courteous, and sympathetic spirit he gained the confidence of the one in authority, and at the same time prepared the way for his own eventual release.</article>

    <shortdescription>While Joseph is in prison, the king's butler and baker are cast into prison because they offended the king. The captain of the guard gives Joseph charge of them.</shortdescription>
    <article>Some incident, apparently, had aroused Pharaoh’s suspicion that either or both of the two high officials (his butler and baker) were involved in an attempt to poison him. That one of the two was later restored to office and the other executed indicates that investigation had convinced the king of the innocence of the one and the guilt of the other. These two high officials were committed to the custody of the commander of the royal bodyguard. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This officer was Potiphar, the master and owner of Joseph, according to chs. 37:36 and 39:1. Potiphar placed them in the same state prison in which Joseph was held, and since their cases were still under investigation, and they themselves were high officers of state, he charged Joseph to wait upon them and act as their attendant.</article>

    <shortdescription>The Pharaoh has a dream and the chief butler remembers how, while in prison, Joseph interpreted his dream. Pharaoh invites Joseph to interpret his dream, and God gives Joseph insight that leads to him becoming a prince in Egypt. The dream comes true.</shortdescription>
    <article>When the Pharoah of Egypt has a dream that cannot be interpreted, Joseph is remembered by the chief butler to interpret the dream. Joseph declared first of all that the two dreams had the same meaning, and pointed to their Author, God, who thereby sought to warn Pharaoh and his subjects of events to come. The number seven, which played so prominent a role in the dreams, pointed to two periods of seven years each. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The fat cows and the full ears represented seven abundant harvests the lean ones, seven barren years. The latter would follow the former over the whole land of Egypt, so that the years of famine would leave no trace of the seven fruitful years. Joseph added that the repetition of the dream was to emphasize the certainty of the events indicated and the urgency of taking measures to meet the emergency. Joseph’s confidence in his interpretation, which looked 14 years into the future, in contrast with the perplexity of the Egyptian wise men, could not fail to impress the king. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Joseph followed up his interpretation by the advice that Pharaoh should appoint a man as minister of food over the whole land, and a staff of officers to carry out his instructions. Joseph advised also that during the seven years of superabundance a fifth part of the harvest should be levied, as a tax, and stored up throughout the country. Joseph’s counsel was so sound and pleasing to Pharaoh and his counselors that the king proposed the appointment of Joseph as minister of food, and granted him emergency powers.</article>

    <article>The elder son of Joseph, by Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On (Gen 41:50, 51). When before his death Jacob blessed Manasseh and his brother Ephraim, the old patriarch indicated by crossing his arms and placing his left hand upon Manasseh, that Ephraim, though younger, would become superior (ch 48:8–21). This prophecy was later fulfilled when Manasseh’s descendants, though forming an influential tribe in Israel, were surpassed in importance by the tribe descended from Ephraim.</article>

    <shortdescription>Judah's daughter-in-law, Tamar, loses her husband and has no heir. In Levirate marriage law, the brother-in-law is to provide an heir. This does not happen, so Tamar plays a harlot and Judah unknowingly impregnates her. She gives birth to twins.</shortdescription>
    <article>The sudden death of his two older sons, so soon after their marriage to Tamar, made Judah hesitate to give her the third as a husband. In harmony with a superstition found in the Apocryphal book of Tobit (ch. 3:7–10), he may have thought that either she herself, or marriage to her, had in some way occasioned the deaths of Er and Onan. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Therefore he sent her away to her father’s house, with the promise of his youngest son as soon as he had grown up. That Judah never intended to fulfill his promise is clear from his excuse that Shelah might “die also, as his brethren did.” When Shelah had reached a marriageable age but was not given to her, Tamar determined to secure a child by Judah himself. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This was completely in harmony with prevailing Hittite and Assyrian custom. The laws of the Hittites and Assyrians contained the provision that the duty of levirate marriage was to be performed by the father of the deceased if no brother was available. Dressing as a harlot, she deceives Judah, who impregnates her. He leaves a signet with her, not knowing who she is and later condemns her for getting pregnant, only to discover he was the guilty party.</article>

    <shortdescription>Joseph interprets Pharaoh's dream that there will be seven years of plenty and seven years of famine in Egypt. The dream comes true and the famine is widespread. Joseph has stored grain for this time of need. Many come to Egypt seeking grain.</shortdescription>
    <article>As Joseph had foretold, the seven plentiful years were followed by seven years of famine, which affected not only Egypt but surrounding countries as well. Famine conditions in Egypt are produced when the Nile fails to overflow its banks (see v. 34), and this in turn is due to a lack of rainfall in the highlands of Abyssinia. When the Egyptians had consumed their own stores of food they turned to the king, remembering, no doubt, the special grain levy imposed for seven successive years. He directed them to Joseph, the minister of food, who opened the granaries for native Egyptians and for the foreigners who came to Egypt for food. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Joseph’s wisdom as an administrator now became apparent to all. If anyone had had doubt as to his policy of hoarding tremendous quantities of grain year after year, none questioned the prudence of the policy now. What would Pharaoh, a foreign ruler, have done with a famishing population? How could he have averted the overthrow of his own dynasty, except for the forethought of Joseph? This young Hebrew, a former house slave, had become the savior of the throne, of all Egypt, and of surrounding nations as well.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
That Joseph did not distribute the stored grain free to the perishing multitudes was not without reason. The people had certainly been warned of the impending calamity, and might by care and economy have saved a little themselves for the days of want. Since the people had to pay for the grain, they were encouraged to exercise frugality and to avoid wasting the precious supply of food, which must be made to last for seven long years. This plan also enabled Joseph to extend relief to the starving populations of other countries. The fact that the grain was sold back to the people makes it clear that the collection had been made as a form of taxation and not as a public service rendered by the king.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As the drought became more and more severe, and man and beast were both suffering, Jacob made the decision to fetch grain from Egypt to preserve his family from starvation. That he did not, like Abraham (ch. 12:10) and Isaac (ch. 26:2), plan to move his family to Egypt may have been due to the fact that the famine prevailed in Egypt as well as Canaan. Ten sons of Jacob traveled south. That all ten went to Egypt was either for safety or because the grain was distributed to heads of families. Their number would possibly enable them to secure more grain, and would certainly enable them to return with more of it. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Also, the famine conditions would render plundering of their caravan for its supplies of food a very real possibility. Benjamin was not kept back because of his youth, since he was now more than 20 years of age, but because, as the only remaining child of Rachel, he had taken Joseph’s place as the object of Jacob’s most tender affections.</article>

    <shortdescription>After Jacob's sons come to Egypt seeking grain during a widespread famine, Joseph tests them and eventually reveals his identity. Jacob's family then moves to Egypt and lives in Goshen since Egyptians of this time do not like shepherds.</shortdescription>
    <article>God spoke to Jacob. This was apparently the first vision accorded Jacob for many years. Several of the previous revelations had come during the night, mostly in the form of dreams (chs. 28:12 31:11 32:30). This one is not called a dream, which would have come during sleep, but a vision. The Lord told him not to be afraid. This divine admonition reveals the fact that Jacob had feared he might be doing wrong in going to Egypt. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
He yearned to see Joseph, his long-lost son but he also remembered the evil consequences of Abraham’s journey to Egypt (ch. 12:14–20), and that God had once forbidden Isaac to go there during a famine (ch. 26:2). Whether his journey would meet God’s approval may have been a serious question in the patriarch’s mind. Now God expressed approval of the journey and gave him reassuring promises. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As formerly, when setting out for Padan-aram, so now in departing for Egypt, Jacob received the assurance that God would go with him, that the divine promise concerning his posterity was still valid, and that the move into Egypt would not mean the permanent abandonment of the Land of Promise.</article>

    <shortdescription>Joseph has stored grain to sell to the Egyptians during the seven-year drought. The Egyptians have given all their money, their livestock, and even their land to buy grain from Joseph. He charges them 20% interest on crops. The people are grateful.</shortdescription>
    <article>A great social revolution is forced upon Egypt by the stern necessity of famine, which had by now reduced the entire nation to a state of utter misery. The animals that thus became Pharaoh’s property were probably left in the care of their owners. These terms, therefore, were not so severe as it would appear. A famishing people could expect no profit from starving cattle and dying herds. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Now they were to receive fodder for their animals, and probably enjoy a partial profit on them, by analogy to what happened to their land and its produce the next year (see vs. 23, 24). Realizing that their lot as Pharaoh’s serfs would be preferable to that of free but starving citizens, they considered this solution advantageous to themselves as well as to the king. A full stomach was a far happier prospect than starvation.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Joseph distributed, or organized, the population of the land according to the cities in which grain was stored, placing them either in the cities or in their immediate vicinity. The priests formed a most influential and powerful segment of Egyptian society. No Pharaoh ever succeeded in permanently breaking their power, and very few dared to arouse their hatred or even lose their good will. More than half of all the wealth of Egypt was in the hands of the priests. They were tax-exempt throughout Egypt’s ancient history. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The levy of 20 per cent collected during the 7 plentiful years, as an exceptional measure, had not seemed an excessive burden because of the tremendous amount of produce. Henceforth it was to be perpetuated as the regular tax rate, inasmuch as all lands had become the property of the crown. This new regulation was not considered harsh or unjust. It is an adequate refutation of the oft-repeated charge that Joseph despoiled the Egyptians of their liberties and reduced a free people to slavery. Slave-owners are usually not content with a tax of 20 per cent on the gross income of their estates. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Except for the tax, royal ownership of the lands was more nominal than real. At all events, the tax was not considered exorbitant by the people themselves. They were grateful to be able to remain alive and to retain the use of their animals, houses, and lands, even though it be under the nominal lordship of Pharaoh.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "the beloved one." She is the daughter of Amram and the sister of Aaron and Moses. Miriam is described as a prophetess who leads the women in praise after the Red Sea experience. She also expresses jealousy with Aaron of Moses' leadership.</shortdescription>
    <article>The sister of Aaron and Moses (Ex 15:20 Num 26:59). She watched over the ark containing the infant Moses, which was placed by the river’s brink, and negotiated his care (Ex 2:4–9). After the safe crossing of the Red Sea, Miriam, now called a prophetess, led the Israelite women in praise to God for the miraculous deliverance (Ex 15:20, 21 Mic 6:4). Later, with her brother Aaron, she is described as being jealous of Moses’ place of leadership. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The two voiced their dissatisfaction to Moses, using his marriage to a Cushite woman, by which they probably meant Zipporah, the Midianitess, as a pretext for their discontent. They also claimed equality with him, stating that God had spoken through them as well as through him. For her rebellion against God’s will and His chosen instrument Miriam was punished by leprosy, but was healed after Moses interceded for her (Num 12:1–16 Deut 24:9). She died in Kadesh, and was buried there (Num 20:1).</article>

    <shortdescription>Name possibly means "mountaineer" or "mountain of strength." He is the eldest son of Amram &amp; Jochebed and brother to Moses. He marries Elisheba and has 4 sons. He is appointed Moses' spokesman and anointed as the first high priest in the sanctuary.</shortdescription>
    <article>Aaron. Son of Amram and Jochebed (Ex 6:20), and descendant of Levi (1 Chr 6:1–3). He had an older sister, Miriam (Ex 7:7 cf. ch 2:4), and a younger brother, Moses (ch 7:7). He married Elisheba, a daughter of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah, who bore him four sons, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar (ch 6:23). Aaron enters the Bible narrative when the Lord commissioned him to go from Egypt to meet his brother Moses at Mount Horeb (Ex 4:27). There the two conferred together about returning to Egypt to effect the release of their people from bondage (v 28). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Lord had already appeared to Moses, and had indicated to him that Aaron was to be his spokesman in the new assignment (vs 14–16). From that time forth the two brothers labored side by side to secure freedom for their oppressed kinsmen (vs 29, 30 etc.). Even after the departure from Egypt Aaron continued, at least at times, as Moses’ spokesman to the children of Israel (ch 16:9, 10). At Rephidim, a short distance from the Wilderness of Sin, Aaron and Hur sustained the uplifted arms of Moses in the successful battle with a band of Amalekites (ch 17:12).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
During the encampment at Mount Sinai, Aaron and his sons Nadab and Abihu, together with 70 of the elders of Israel, were accorded the special privilege of accompanying Moses beyond the bounds at the foot of the mountain which the people generally might not pass (Ex 24:1–11). During Moses’ prolonged absence from camp, Aaron acquiesced in the demand of the people for visible “gods” by making a golden calf and leading in its worship (ch 32). While the Israelites were still encamped at Sinai, Aaron and his sons were appointed and consecrated to serve as priests in the sanctuary (Ex 28:40 to 29:37 40:13–16 Lev 8). Aaron served as high priest for 38 years, until within a few months of the entry into Canaan (Num 20:22–29).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Soon after the departure from Sinai, Aaron and Miriam united in opposing Moses as supreme commander of Israel, under God, and claimed for themselves a voice in the administration of the nation. God decisively silenced the two who had presumed to challenge the one whom He had appointed leader (Num 12:1–15). Somewhat later a group of disaffected Levites united forces with certain men of the tribe of Reuben, and others, in revolt against the leadership of Moses and Aaron, and once more God vindicated His chosen leaders (ch 16). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Lest there should be any lingering doubt concerning the fact that it was God who had appointed Aaron to have charge of the religious life of the nation, God gave dramatic proof by causing Aaron’s rod to bud, blossom, and bear almonds overnight (ch 17). Toward the close of the 40 years in the wilderness, almost on the borders of Canaan, Aaron joined with Moses in a demonstration of impatience at Kadesh, where the latter impetuously struck the rock from which water was to flow forth for the people. As a result, the two brothers were barred from entering the Land of Promise (ch 20:7–13).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Not long after the experience at Kadesh the people of Israel broke camp and journeyed around the borders of Edom, having been refused permission to take a more direct route through that country. On the way the Lord directed Moses and Aaron that the latter should prepare to lay down his duties and to die (Num 20:22–24 cf. Deut 10:6). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
By divine order the high-priestly robes were taken from Aaron and placed on his son Eleazar, in token of his succession to Aaron as high priest (Num 20:25–28). Aaron died at the age of 123 (cf. Ex 7:7 Deut 34:7), and was buried on Mount Hor on the border of Edom (Num 20:27, 28 33:37–39 Deut 32:50). He was mourned by Israel for a period of 30 days (Num 20:29).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>He is the son of Amram and Jochebed, the younger brother of Aaron and Miriam. Moses was the great deliverer of Israel from Egypt, a leader through the wilderness wanderings, great lawgiver, and writer of the Pentateuch.</shortdescription>
    <article>Moses. The deliverer of the Hebrew people from Egyptian bondage, their leader through the wilderness wandering, their great lawgiver, and the author of the Pentateuch.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Moses spent the first 40 years of his life quite likely under the 18th dynasty kings: Thutmose I (c. 1542 – c. 1524 b.c.), and Thutmose II (c. 1524 – c. 1504 b.c.), and Queen Hatshepsut (c. 1504 – c. 1486 b.c.), a daughter of Thutmose I and on the basis of the chronology here suggested doubtless the “daughter of Pharaoh” referred to in Ex 2:5–10. Moses was the son of Amram and Jochebed, and a descendant of Levi in the 4th generation (Ex 6:16–20), of the family of Kohath (vs 18–20). His brother Aaron was 3 years older than he (ch 7:7), and he had an older sister, Miriam (ch 15:20 cf. ch 2:6, 7). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
At Moses’ birth the children of Israel had been in Egypt about 135 years. The Hebrews had multiplied rapidly until “the land was filled with them” and they had become “more and mightier” than the Egyptians, or at least the latter so claimed (ch 1:7–9). Because the Hebrews were numerically strong, and because the Egyptians urgently needed cheap labor for their vast building projects, it is little wonder that the kings of this new dynasty instituted a policy of keeping them in subjection at forced labor (vs 10–14). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
How long prior to Moses’ birth the Hebrews were set to work building the “treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses” (v 11) and were made to “serve with rigour” (vs 12–14) is not known. But the more the Egyptians oppressed them “the more they multiplied and grew” (Ex 1:12), and efforts to check the rapid increase in population proved wholly ineffective.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
At his birth Moses’ parents recognized him to be “a goodly child” (Ex 2:2). Their efforts to preserve Moses alive are referred to in Heb 11:23 as an act of faith, implying perhaps an awareness on their part that God had destined him for an important role and would intervene to preserve his life. By putting Moses in an ark of bulrushes and placing him on the bosom of the Nile, Jochebed was complying with the letter of the law that required male children to be offered in sacrifice to the Nile, which the Egyptians worshiped as a god, supposing that its waters had power to impart fertility and guarantee long life. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The visit of Pharaoh’s daughter to the river “to wash herself” (Ex 2:5) may have been a ritual ablution designed to secure these supposed benefits for herself. The appearance of Moses floating in his little ark of bulrushes as if he were a gift from the Nile god, in answer to her prayers, apparently impressed her as a happy omen. The princess took the child as her own, hiring his own mother as his nurse.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When he was 40 (Acts 7:23)—c. 1485 b.c.—Moses knew that the time had come when he must choose between his Hebrew faith and the throne of Egypt. Inbred loyalty to God (Heb 11:24–26) and an awareness of God’s purpose for his life (Acts 7:25) led Moses to cast his lot with his own people and “to suffer affliction” with them rather than “enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season” (Heb 11:25). Acting rashly, Moses slew an (Ex 2:11, 12), Egyptian taskmaster (Ex 2:11, 12), and by this foolish act he played into the hands of his enemies, perhaps especially Thutmose III, who now would have a legitimate reason to bring Moses to trial and to destroy him. It is quite possible that these were the circumstances that led Moses to flee from Egypt and to find refuge in the land of Midian to the east (v 15).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Under divine guidance Moses led Israel forth from the land of their servitude (Ex 13:17–22). After a series of crises and providential deliverances, Moses and the Hebrew people arrived at Mount Sinai (ch 19:1, 2). On the mount Moses received directly from God instructions for the establishment of the Hebrew nation as a theocracy (Ex 24:9–11 33:11, 17–23 34:5–29 etc.), including the basic law of the Ten Commandments, which were also spoken audibly to the entire congregation (ch 20:1–18) and later inscribed upon 2 tables of stone and preserved in the ark (ch 31:18 34:1–4 Deut 10:1–5). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As spokesman for God, Moses led the people into the covenant relationship which constituted a theocracy (Ex 19:5–8 24:3–8). God then summoned Moses to meet with Him in the mount (ch 24:12), where He revealed complete plans for the erection of the tabernacle, which was to be His dwelling place as their king (chs 25–31), and at the same time also gave him the 2 tables of the law (ch 31:18).</article>

    <shortdescription>Moses is adopted by Pharaoh's daughter when she discovers him in the Nile. Jochebed becomes his "nurse," but when he is weaned, he comes to Pharaoh's daughter and he becomes her son. Thus he grows to manhood in the courts of Pharaoh.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jochebed had saved her son’s life by transferring her rights as mother to Pharaoh’s daughter. Now she received him back, on loan as it were, and merely as a nurse hired for his years of infancy. She gave him up that she might keep him, lost him that she might find him again, stooped that she might conquer. The time the child was with its mother, not stated in the Bible but given as 2 or 3 years by most commentators, was actually about 12 years. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
During these years of childhood the foundations of character and later religious experience were laid. Instruction neglected now could not be made up later. Moses’ afterlife shows clearly that his parents used well the years allotted them for bringing him up in the way in which he should go.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Many commentators have expressed the view that Moses’ mother took her son to the palace of her own volition as soon as he was weaned, at the age of perhaps two or three years. As noted above, this actually occurred at about the age of 12. The idea that she surrendered him voluntarily is based on the absence of any indication that she was forced to give him up. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Unless she took him to the palace at a time previously agreed upon, to do so on her own initiative would seem to show a strange lack of motherly affection. Would Jochebed have given up a son she loved so dearly without being required to do so? She must have kept him as long as she could. Her surrender of Moses at the age of 12 would imply that her term of service as “nurse” was to expire with the close of what was generally considered the period of childhood.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When Moses was returned to the court of Pharaoh he received the highest military and civil training as a son of the ruler in order to prepare him to be a successor to the throne (see Acts 7:22).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>One day Moses, as a grown man, goes to see his "brethren" and observes an Egyptian beating a Hebrew. Moses kills the Egyptian and buries him in the sand. Word gets out and Pharaoh seeks to kill Moses who flees to Midian.</shortdescription>
    <article>The Sacred Record passes over almost 30 years of Moses’ life in silence. The next recorded event is of an incident that took place when he was 40 years old (Acts 7:23). The years of his youth were spent under royal tutors, who imparted to him “all the wisdom of the Egyptians” (Acts 7:22). Some of his education he received from the priests, and some from army commanders. Such was the training ordinarily given a royal prince. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Since Moses was “mighty in words and in deeds” (Acts 7:22), it would not be amiss to assume that he led important military expeditions to foreign countries. However, he did not become an Egyptian at heart. His outward appearance, his dress, his speech, and his behavior may have been completely Egyptian, but he remained a Hebrew in character, religion, and loyalty. This is clear from the events narrated in Ex. 2:11–13 (see Heb. 11:24).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Moses had come to the point in his life when he realized that he must either become an Egyptian, without reservation, or side with his despised people. It seems that prior to this occasion he had made the decision “to suffer affliction with the people of God” (Heb. 11:25) and considered himself the chosen instrument for this task (Acts 7:23–25). He thought himself ready at last to leave the court with its “pleasures of sin,” to abandon the prospect of succession to the throne, and to step forth boldly to champion the cause of his oppressed people. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
From Acts 7:23 it is clear that Moses went to the land of Goshen for the purpose of studying the situation and laying plans. That in his mind he had relinquished all claim to the throne of Egypt is evidence that his motives were not selfish. He was impelled, rather, by sincere love for his people and hatred for their oppressors, a fact emphasized by the term “brethren,” used twice in Ex. 2:11.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Moses saw an Egyptian. This was probably one of the taskmasters mentioned in ch. 1:11 or one of the overseers employed by them. Such persons are represented on Egyptian monuments as armed with long wooden sticks, which they used freely on the backs of idlers. Their authority was no doubt frequently abused, and chastisement was no doubt inflicted for the slightest fault or for no fault at all. Authority often degenerates into tyranny and cruel oppression, and as an instance of such abuse of power this incident excited the anger of Moses (Acts 7:24). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Observing that there were no others to witness the deed, he killed the Egyptian. That the overseer continued beating the Hebrew workman as Moses approached shows that higher officials generally approved of such abuse of authority on the part of their subordinates. Moses’ action cannot be condoned, though it was no doubt prompted by righteous indignation. Although an able military leader and a favorite with the armies of Egypt, he was lacking in certain qualities of leadership essential for service in the cause of God.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Moses hoped the Hebrews would accept his leadership and support him in a general uprising against the Egyptians. Though it had been revealed to the elders of Israel that Moses was to be their deliverer, “they understood not” (Acts 7:25). The fact that he spent more than one day among his own people suggests that this was more than a casual visit. His return to the vicinity of the incident suggests that he considered the time ripe for revolt. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The strife Moses witnessed upon his second visit among his people was one in which blows were exchanged, and he felt it his duty to persuade the two men to refrain from further combat. By interposing here Moses certainly did what was right. Having renounced his allegiance to Egypt by his deed the day before, to be rejected now by his own people left Moses in a dangerous predicament. He was alone and without friends.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Moses’ flight was certainly not an easy one. The eastern border of Egypt was guarded from the Mediterranean Sea to the Gulf of Suez by a system of manned towers, each in sight of the next. An Egyptian story parallel to the flight of Moses, that of Sinuhe, shows how difficult an escape into Asia really was. Sinuhe, a courtier of King Amenemhet I, for some reason unknown to us, felt at the king’s death that his own life was in danger, and accordingly fled to Syria, where he spent many years as an exile. He gives a vivid description of the dangers connected with crossing the frontier. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Crouching for some time in a bush, lest the watchmen see him, he crossed at night. Pressing on into the desert, he would have perished of thirst except for certain Asiatics who found him and gave him water and boiled milk to drink. We have no record of the hardships Moses suffered during his flight, but it is not amiss to assume that it was a trying experience for one who had thus far known only the luxuries of court life and was unacquainted with hardship.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "dog." He is the son of Jephunneh, a Kenizzite and listed as one of the 12 spies sent to investigate the Promised Land before the Israelites enter. Only Caleb and Joshua return with a positive report and live to enter it.</shortdescription>
    <article>A son of Jephunneh, a Kenizzite (Num 32:12). He represented the tribe of Judah as one of the 12 Israelite leaders who were sent out from Kadesh-barnea as spies to investigate the land of Canaan, and only he and Joshua returned with encouraging reports the other spies completely disheartened the people with their pessimistic reports (Num 13 14). Caleb also took part in the conquest of the land some 40 years later, and was a member of the commission to distribute the land among the 12 tribes (Num 34:19 Jos 14:6–14 15:13–15). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
At that time, being 85 years old, he received Hebron and its neighboring territory as an inheritance, and drove out the Anakim from it, while his younger relative Othniel took Debir and thus obtained Caleb’s daughter Achsah as wife (Jos 14:13–15 15:13–17). “The south of Caleb” (1 Sa 30:14) probably refers to the area of Hebron and Debir.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "Jehovah is Savior" or "God is deliverer." He is the son of Nun from the tribe of Ephraim and successor to Moses as leader of Israel. Joshua is one of 12 spies into Canaan who come back with a good report. He leads Israel into Canaan.</shortdescription>
    <article>Joshua. A son of Nun of the tribe of Ephraim (Num 13:8, 16). Except for Jochebed, Moses’ mother, Joshua was the first OT person to bear a name compounded with the divine name Yahweh. He was Moses’ military commander during the wilderness wanderings, and is first mentioned in connection with his victory over the Amalekites a few days before the Hebrews arrived at Mount Sinai (Ex 17:8–16). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As Moses’ assistant or “minister” he accompanied Moses on the ascent of Mount Sinai (ch 24:13). At Kadesh-barnea, 2 years after the Exodus, Joshua represented the tribe of Ephraim on the expedition to spy out the Promised Land. He and Caleb alone returned with a favorable report (Num 13:8, RSV 14:6–9 cf. 14:7), and were therefore accorded the privilege of entering Canaan 38 years later (ch 14:30–38). Shortly before his death, Moses publicly inaugurated Joshua as his successor (Num 27:18–23 Deut 1:38 31:23). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When Moses died, Joshua began immediate preparations to enter Canaan (Jos 1:10, 11). He dispatched 2 spies to secure a report on the state of affairs in Jericho (ch 2:1), and when preparations were complete led the people over the Jordan (Jos 4:10–19). After the capture of Jericho and Ai (chs 6 8), Joshua met and defeated one coalition of Canaanite kings at Gibeon, near Jerusalem (ch 10), and another at Hazor in the northern part of the country (ch 11). After these preliminary conquests, Joshua set about dividing the land of Canaan among the tribes (chs 13–21), his inheritance, by his own request, being at Timnath-serah in Mount Ephraim (ch 19:50). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
At the age of 110 he gathered Israel together, counseled them to be faithful to the Lord (ch 24:1–28), and died (vs 29, 30).</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "lion of God." He is the first judge of Israel and receives the daughter of Caleb, Achsah, when he bravely leads a successful expedition against Debir. Under him the land has rest for forty years.</shortdescription>
    <article>A son of Kenaz, and either a younger brother or a nephew of Caleb (Jos 15:17 Jgs 1:13 1 Chr 4:13). He distinguished himself by capturing the town of Debir (or Kiriath-sepher) in Judah from the Canaanites. As a reward he received Achsah, Caleb’s daughter, who had been promised to the conqueror of that city (Jos 15:15–17 Jgs 1:11–13). His bravery was exhibited once more when he defeated Cushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia, who had oppressed the Israelites for 8 years. His victory brought 40 years of peace to his country, and he became the 1st of the judges (Jgs 3:8–11).</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "God has helped." He is the third son of Aaron and Elisheba. He is put in charge of the sanctuary after his two older brothers Nadab and Abihu died. He is clothed with his father's priestly garments on Mount Hor before Aaron dies.</shortdescription>
    <article>The third son of Aaron (Ex 6:23 Num 3:2). He served as priest with his father and brothers during the wilderness wanderings (Ex 28:1, 44 Num 3:4 16:39 19:3). He outlived his older brothers, whom God slew when they offered strange fire (Lev 10:1–7), and was divinely appointed as high priest when his father died (Num 20:25–28 cf. Deut 10:6). He took part in the division of the Promised Land (Jos 14:1). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
He was buried near the home of his son Phinehas, who succeeded him as high priest (ch 24:33 Jgs 20:28). Eleazar was the ancestor of the Zadokite priests, who in Solomon’s time won precedence over the family of Abiathar, which descended from Ithamar, Eleazar’s younger brother (1 Chr 6:4–15 1 Ki 2:26, 27, 35).</article>

    <shortdescription>While tending his father-in-law's sheep near Mt. Horeb, Moses sees a burning bush. God speaks to Moses through the burning bush and calls him to lead the children of Israel out of Egypt. Moses feels inadequate. God answers all 5 of Moses' objections.</shortdescription>
    <article>The burning bush was an appropriate visible representation of the message God there imparted to Moses. In contrast to the more noble and lofty trees (Judges 9:15), the thorn bush may be compared to the people of Israel in their humiliation, despised by the world. The fire, burning but not consuming the bush, may be thought of as representing the refining affliction of slavery. But the bush was not consumed and in the chastening flame the Lord does not give His people over unto death (Ps. 118:18). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As Moses approached the bush he did not expect to receive a vision, nor was he yet conscious of the presence of God. Therefore, when he drew near to examine “this great sight” (v. 3), he was admonished to remain at a safe distance from the bush. The place where Moses stood was holy, not because it was an old sanctuary or sacred spot previously unknown as such to him, as some commentators have thought, but because of the presence of God. The glory of the holy God no sinful man can bear hence it was only natural for Moses to hide his face. Elijah later did likewise at the same place (1 Kings 19:13), and even the holy angels before God’s throne in heaven do so (Isa. 6:2).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
God called Moses to bring the Israelites out of Egypt into a land flowing with milk and honey. A great change had come over Moses. Forty years earlier he had volunteered as a deliverer. He had gone to his brethren and slain one of their oppressors, expecting that they would understand “that God by his hand would deliver them” (Acts 7:25). However, at that time he was not qualified for the position of leadership to which he aspired, nor were the children of Israel ready for deliverance. The 40 years in Midian had taught him humility and filled him with utter distrust of self. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The adopted prince of Egypt’s royal house had become a shepherd, following a pursuit despised by the Egyptians (Gen. 46:34), and felt so uncertain of himself as to fear Pharaoh. What influence could he, a despised shepherd from the eastern desert, expect to have with the mighty king of the most powerful nation on earth? Furthermore, what influence would he have with his own people? They had rejected him when he was a mighty man would they accept his leadership as a returned fugitive? Thoughts like these may have flashed through Moses’ mind when the call to return to Egypt and deliver his people came to him. His reluctance to accept the call, his distrust of himself and of his people, can be easily understood. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
God did not refute Moses’ arguments, but assured him of divine companionship and assistance. No human skill, no earthly power or ingenuity alone, can accomplish what is possible in cooperation with God. No greater promise can come to a leader of God’s people than that given to Moses at the time he was called.</article>

    <shortdescription>Moses demands of Pharaoh to "let my people go." Pharaoh is reluctant, but after many plagues tells them to leave Egypt. When the people come to the Red Sea with Pharaoh's army behind them, God miraculously leads them through the waters to safety.</shortdescription>
    <article>The departure, or journey, of the Israelites from Egypt after they had lived in that country for more than four centuries and had been held in slavery for some time. This migration, accomplished under the leadership of Moses, was accompanied by many miracles. The story of the departure from Egypt is related primarily in the book of Exodus, chapters 1 to 14, with the preceding events narrated in the last chapters of Genesis. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
After showing some reluctance at the first, Moses accepted the divine call and became his nation’s greatest leader. Arriving in Egypt, Moses requested that Pharaoh release the Israelites. His request met only with refusal and ridicule, as did subsequent requests. As a result ten plagues in all were brought upon Egypt, some of them real catastrophes. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Only after the Egyptians had lost heavily of their crops and domestic animals, had been smitten with diseases, and had lost their first-born children, did Pharaoh give in and allow the Israelites to leave Egypt. The departure took place on the 15th day of the month Abib, the morning after the Passover supper, which was initiated at that time by divine order, to be celebrated by the Israelites henceforth as a feast in memory of their liberation from slavery.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Leaving Goshen, the area of their habitation, they were led in a southerly direction until they reached the northwestern shore of the Red Sea. They were prevented from taking the shortest route to Canaan, because they were unprepared to meet the opposition of the nations they would face on that route. At the Red Sea, Pharaoh, who in the meantime had recovered from his initial shock of losing the crown prince, and who now regretted having allowed the Israelites to depart, overtook the Israelites, hoping to force them to return to Egypt. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It was then that God divided the waters of the Red Sea and enabled His people to pass through to the eastern shore. The pursuing Egyptians, on the other hand, were swallowed up by the returning waters. The crossing of the Red Sea marked the accomplishment of the departure or exodus from Egypt proper and the beginning of the Wilderness Wandering.</article>

    <shortdescription>When the Israelites come to Mt. Sinai after leaving Egypt God asks Moses to prepare the people for a revelation of Himself. God's holiness is emphasized in the preparations of this amazing appearing in thunder, lightning, earthquake, smoke, and fire.</shortdescription>
    <article>The law recorded in Ex 20:2–17, also called the Decalogue, which sums up what God requires of man, and defines his duty toward God and toward his fellow men (cf. Mt 22:34–40). The principles enunciated by the Ten Commandments are eternal, for they are based upon the character of God, but the form in which these principles were uttered at Sinai was adapted to the understanding and instruction of men in their state of sinfulness and natural nonconformity to the divine will. The 10 commands of the Decalogue have the unique distinction of being the only words addressed audibly by God to the entire congregation of Israel (see Ex 20:1, 18, 19 Deut 4:10–13 5:22). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
All of the other laws and regulations God ordained at that time were communicated through Moses as an intermediary (see Ex 20:19–22 Deut 4:14 Deut 6:1). Subsequent to the oral delivery of the law God inscribed these 10 commands upon 2 tables of stone which He gave to Moses to be preserved in the ark (Ex 31:18 32:19 34:1–4 Deut 5:22 10:1–5). Moses’ original account of the law as proclaimed by God, and later engraved upon the tables of stone, gives the Decalogue in the wording of Ex 20:1–17. Later Moses repeated the law in oral form with slight variations in wording (Deut 5:6–21). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The only noteworthy difference in this repetition of the law is the reason assigned for the observance of the 7th-day Sabbath— deliverance from Egyptian bondage, in place of the creation of the world in 6 days, as in the original form. The many civil regulations enacted at Mount Sinai were an application of the principles of the second table of the Decalogue to the society and needs of the Jewish people. The ceremonial law, which sets forth a divinely ordained system of worship appropriate to the period of earth’s history when that law was given, was an extension and development of the principles enunciated in the Decalogue particularly with respect to man’s relationship to his God.</article>

    <shortdescription>God instructs Moses to choose 12 men from each tribe to spy out the land of Canaan. They return with a divided report. Ten men describe the land as impossible to "take" but Joshua and Caleb say, "We are able to take it." They are almost stoned.</shortdescription>
    <article>God instructs Moses to send 12 spies to look at the land of Canaan. When they return 10 of them give an "evil report." The message given was most disheartening, though not necessarily false so far as the facts were concerned. The word translated “brought up” signifies “to invent,” to “spread around.” Appearances no doubt seemed to justify the evil report. From a human point of view the conquest of Canaan may have seemed impossible. But God had promised the land to them and commanded them to enter in and subdue it. Their failure to do so at this time reflected doubt as to the power of God to give it to them.</article>

    <shortdescription>Korah is a Levite and closely related to Moses and Aaron. He and other Levites challenge the priestly leadership of Aaron. God destroys Korah, Dathan, Abiram, and 250 men who are offering incense. The next day Moses intercedes for all the people.</shortdescription>
    <article>Korah resented holding a position lower than his fellow tribesman, Aaron, who had been made high priest. He was joined by Dathan, Abiram, and On, Reubenites, who aspired to be leaders, seeing that they belonged to the tribe descended from the first-born of Jacob. Korah and many of the rebels were destroyed when the ground opened and swallowed them up. An accompanying fire destroyed the priests who had joined them in the rebellion (Num 16:1–49; 26:9–11; 27:3; Jude 11). </article>

    <shortdescription>When the Israelites complain to Moses in Kadesh that there is no water, God instructs him to speak to a rock, but not strike it. Moses disobeys and strikes the rock twice. Water still comes forth. The rock symbolizes Christ who was smitten for us.</shortdescription>
    <article>Numbers 20 begins the account of events that led to the exclusion of Moses and Aaron from the Promised Land. Evidently the water provided for them since the miracle at Horeb (Ex. 17:1–7) some 40 years ago had now been cut off. This was brought about by God in order to test the faith of the new generation that had grown up in the wilderness. The people complained against Moses. God instructed Moses to speak to the rock.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Moses gathered the people and spoke to them as being rebels. The very language God had used concerning their fathers (ch. 17:10). But with Moses it reflected personal anger rather than zeal for God, and herein lay his sin. He spoke as if the watered depended upon himself, not God The use of the personal pronoun applied by Moses to himself and Aaron indicated a disregard of God, as though these two men would have the people think they could perform a miracle by their own power.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Then Moses struck the rock twice. Part of the sin of Moses lay in the double striking of the rock, for God had not told him to strike it. In addition, Moses forgot the patience of God in His dealings with the people, which should have been reflected in his own attitude and demeanor. He spoke and acted as if the murmurings were against himself. God met the situation with an abundant supply of water, in spite of the attitude of Moses and Aaron. Because of their lack of faith they were not permited to lead the children of Israel in to the promised land.</article>

    <shortdescription>Balak, whose name means "empty," the son of Zippor, is the king of the Moabites and afraid when Israel comes into his land. He hires Balaam to curse the Israelites.</shortdescription>
    <article>Balak and the Moabites were afraid of the children of Israel. The king and his people were believers in the power of the sorcerer and his incantations. Magic, the black art, and devil possession are the natural accompaniments of idolatry. Balak realized he needed more than human help to cope with the apparent power of Israel. Balak was planning to destroy Israel but was afraid to attempt it in his own strength. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
He had heard of the effectiveness of Balaam’s powers. In ancient times blessing and cursing were both common, as by Noah (Gen. 9:25–27), Isaac (Gen. 27:27), Jacob (Gen. 49), Joshua (Joshua 6:26), and Elisha (2 Kings 2:24). Similarly, Goliath prefaced his combat with David by calling down the curse of his gods upon the lad (1 Sam. 17:43). It is folly to seek to explain all the phenomena of heathen magic by assuming it to be merely trickery. Balaam is summoned. An apostate prophet plays with fire, in the hope of worldly gain. Balaam already knew of the Israelites and of God’s attitude toward them. Nevertheless, he is greedy and agrees to try to curse Israel.</article>

    <shortdescription>Balak, king of Moab, hires Balaam to curse Israel. God instructs Balaam not to go, but he desires the payment and goes, but God's Spirit works through Balaam and he prophesies good toward Israel, much to the displeasure of Balak.</shortdescription>
    <article>God had made known His mind to Balaam. But the Lord allowed him to go. This was merely a permissive directive, based not on God’s will but on Balaam’s self-will. Had the prophet desired God’s will the words recorded would have settled the matter. But when a man is rebellious at heart God may permit him to follow his desires and suffer the consequences (see Ps. 81:11, 12 Hosea 4:17). Balaam is an example of a prophet who prostitutes his calling, seeking to make gain of his divine gift. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Accordingly, we read of the “doctrine of Balaam” (Rev. 2:14), the “error of Balaam” (Jude 11), and the “way of Balaam” (2 Peter 2:15). After Balaam's "talking donkey" tried to persuade him not to go, he still went. When Balaam tried to curse Israel, only blessing came from his lips. Balak's anger was kindled. Upon arriving at his home Balaam conceived a scheme by which the downfall of Israel might be brought about (see ch. 31:16), and returned immediately to Moab to lay his plan before the king. King Balak died soon after in battle (ch. 31:8).</article>

    <shortdescription>Just as the Red Sea parted at the beginning of Israel's freedom from Egypt, so the crossing of the Jordan marks their entry into the Promised Land. Like a baptism, it symbolizes a Christian's acceptance of Christ who also was baptized in the Jordan.</shortdescription>
    <article>Before crossing the Jordan into the Promised Land, the Israelites had camped more than two months in Shittim, having arrived here by the 1st day of the 11th month in the 40th year after they had left Egypt (Deut. 1:3). This, their first march under Joshua, was only about 7 mi. in length, but may have required most of the day, on account of the flocks and the little ones. At the close of the three days Joshua sent officers through the camp with a second proclamation. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
According to ch. 4:19, the people crossed the Jordan on the 10th day of Abib, the 1st month. Crossing the Jordan was to do for Joshua what the giving of the law at Sinai did for Moses—“that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever” (Ex. 19:9). Both men were established before the people because they were first established with God.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The river overflowed its banks at this time of the year (v. 15). The priests were to enter the shallow water at the edge. When the water had ceased flowing, they were to proceed to the middle of the river and remain there until all Israel had passed over. The waters flowed on and left the whole river bed dry, from a point above the ark down to the Dead Sea. This was a distance of several miles, and provided ample room for the multitude of people, with their cattle, to pass over quickly (see on v. 16). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The people must have been in a state of great expectancy. They knew that something unusual was to happen (v. 5). The officers had already instructed the people about following the ark (v. 3), but nothing had been said as to where it would lead them. Joshua had sent the word around the camp that they should sanctify themselves (v. 5), and now he called them to hear additional instructions the Lord had given him. He informed the people as to precisely what would happen. Sharing this information with the people bound them more closely to him. This marked him as a wise and able leader, for an informed people can follow their leader more intelligently.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The priests carrying the ark were to manifest their faith in God’s word by stepping into the water. God ever calls upon His people not only to face difficulties but to march boldly forward in faith, at His command, confident that He will open a way. He has promised to turn the waters aside and to overcome all obstacles (Isa. 43:2).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The miracle of the Red Sea, the opening of a path through the waters, is here repeated as evidence that God has the same power to complete the salvation of His people that He had to begin it (see Heb. 12:2). Why did the Lord have Israel wait until Jordan was in flood stage before crossing? A month earlier or a month later this would not have been so, and they had been encamped at Shittim for two months. There were probably two reasons: (1) God’s power would be more evident (see on Ex. 9:16 see also 2 Cor. 12:9). (2) &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The people in Jericho would not be expecting them, and would not have guards at the river. Being fearful and intending to resist, the people of Jericho could be expected to guard the fords of Jordan, where it would have been easy to resist the Israelites. The people of Jericho remembered well the report of Israel crossing the Red Sea 40 years previously, and this even yet struck terror to their hearts (Joshua 2:9, 10) a repetition of that miracle, close at hand, could be counted on to intensify their fear. For God, the volume of water in the Jordan made no difference.</article>

    <shortdescription>After strategically creating a wedge in Canaan, Joshua's troops conquer the southland and northland and his conquests are described as destroying everything that breathed and taking "the whole land according to all that the Lord has said to Moses."</shortdescription>
    <article>According to ch. 14:7–10, the conquest of Canaan must have required 6 or 7 years. Caleb, who was 40 when Moses sent him as a spy from Kadesh-barnea, about 2 years after they had left Egypt, was now 85 years old. Thus it was between 38 and 39 years from Kadesh to the time when Israel laid siege to Jericho. Subtracting 78 or 79 from 85 leaves 6 or 7 years for the campaign. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It would seem that the writer, by inserting the statement here to the effect that the wars continued a long time, designed to guard the reader against the impression that, since the record of these wars is very brief, the space of time in which they were accomplished was also brief. God had given a definite reason for prolonging the time of conquest: “lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee” (Deut. 7:22). Perhaps, also, the long series of arduous struggles was designed to develop the faith of His people.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Although in the commands of Moses for the extermination of the Canaanites there seems to be no intimation that in case any of them surrendered to Jehovah they were to be spared, yet judging by the case of Rahab and the Gibeonites, and especially by the words of the text, this was apparently possible. If these nations, doomed to destruction, had renounced their idolatry and had come to cooperate sincerely with Israel, there would have been no danger to Israel. Thus the reason prompting the decree to destroy them would have disappeared, and consequently, we may suppose, the obligation to do so (see Jer. 18:7, 8). But apparently these heathen nations were not disposed to recognize the true God.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
God might have chosen other means for the accomplishment of His judgments upon these nations. His choice of the arms of Israel as His instrument of destruction was for the benefit of the Israelites. They needed to be brought face to face with various tests that would try their faith and prepare them to fulfill their high spiritual destiny. Their failure at Kadesh and the resultant delay in their entry into Canaan had greatly increased the difficulties of the invasion. The Canaanitish nations were thus given ample time to build up their defenses and to prepare their military forces. God intended the extended conquest to be for the discipline of His people, to help them to overcome where formerly they had failed.</article>

    <shortdescription>God calls Joshua to "conquer the land." In pursuit of the Amorites, Joshua calls on God to cause the sun to stand still for a whole day in order to finish off the battle. Never before or after in all history has a miracle like this taken place.</shortdescription>
    <article>When King Adoni-Zedek of Jerusalem (before it was conquered by Israel) heard of the Israelites victories, he gathered other kings to attack Gibeon (an ally to Israel). When Joshua heard of this, he responded immediately. The Gibeonites were in sore straits. Their defenses were in adequate against so powerful a coalition. They appealed to Joshua, in the hope that he, despite their fraud, would come to their aid. The way in which they looked to their allies for help in time of trouble may be thought of as illustrating how we may call upon God for assistance when we are hard pressed by spiritual foes. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
We may feel unworthy of divine aid because of our sins, but we may also know for certain that no sincere prayer for help will be unanswered. It is clear that Joshua did not undertake the expedition without seeking counsel of God. He seems at last to have learned this lesson. Joshua was a man of dispatch. The task at hand required immediate action. Many a cause is defeated by lack of action, or action that comes too late. Joshua marched all night, and in the morning was ready for action before the enemy had time to prepare for battle.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When Joshua realized he needed more daylight to finish his job, he called on God for the sun to stand still. The verb here translated “stand still” is generally rendered “be silent.” However, it can also mean “be motionless,” depending upon what it is applied to. Being addressed to the sun and moon, which ordinarily have no sound, it would naturally have the meaning of the latter. The inspired writer used the popular language of the day in describing matters of science. Actually it is not the sun that moves in the heavens but the earth turning on its axis that marks off the day. But even in our modern age of scientific enlightenment we speak of the sun rising or setting. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Some, whose limited concept of God leaves Him powerless to interfere with natural law, feel that a halt in the rotation of the earth would have disastrous effects upon the earth itself and possibly upon the entire solar system, if not the universe. Whether the phenomenon was produced in this fashion or by the refraction of light or in some other way, the fact remains that a miracle of some kind occurred. If we believe in an omnipotent God, who, as Creator and Sustainer, controls the works of His creation, there is no problem.</article>

    <shortdescription>As Joshua and Israel conquer the land, though not totally, it is divided and given to the different tribes of Israel. Joshua 13-19 gives a full geographical reference to the land of Israel. Leaving a few Canaanites slowly leads Israel into idolatry.</shortdescription>
    <article>Joshua 14 is a preface to the division of the land among the nine and a half tribes. The time had come for the Israelites to disperse themselves and to take over their new conquests. Canaan would have been subdued in vain, if it was not now inhabited. Centuries had passed since the call of Abram out of Ur of the Chaldees, and since the promise that his seed should inherit the land. God’s promises are sometimes long delayed because of the unfaithfulness of those to whom they are made. It is our privilege to hasten the fulfillment of His promises.</article>

    <shortdescription>After Joshua conquers the land of Canaan and divides up the inheritance for the tribes, the children of Israel give an inheritance to Joshua, a city named Timnath Serah in the mountains of Ephraim where he built a city and lived.</shortdescription>
    <article>Joshua was the last to receive his inheritance. We see in this sequence the magnanimity of this great leader. He was not striving to reap all the benefits by virtue of his office, which he could readily have done. He shunned the temptation to which leaders are constantly exposed, namely, to enhance their own coffers with little consideration for those in less favorable positions. Joshua was last served, though the eldest and greatest man in Israel. He sought the good of his country above any private interests of his own. He is a great example to all who serve in public places whether in civil or church leadership. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It is further noted that he did not take the inheritance to himself without the people’s consent and approbation. The record says that the children of Israel gave it to him. They loved their leader. No wonder the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua (Joshua 24:31 Judges 2:7). Such unselfish service begets love, which, in turn, prompts obedience. No one really has a right to leadership until he has learned to serve unselfishly. Christ, who pleased not Himself (Rom. 15:3), is the great exemplar of unselfish service.</article>

    <shortdescription>After Joshua's death the Israelites turn from God and are oppressed by King Cushan-Rishathaim for 8 years. The children of Israel cry out to the Lord, and Othniel from the tribe of Judah is raised up and delivers them, and 40 years of peace come.</shortdescription>
    <article>Israel turned from God after Joshua's death. When they were oppressed, they cried out to God. With self-confidence gone, illusive dreams of pleasure vanished, the people at last turned to their God. They suddenly came to the realization that idolatry had betrayed them and that heathen idols were entirely impotent to help them. With this realization, they turned again to the God of their fathers. It has been aptly remarked that affliction makes those cry to God with importunity who before would scarcely speak to Him. Yet that is the divine purpose of trials. That the people did turn to the Lord in their trouble is to their credit. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When the Israelites cried to God in their distress, He heard and raised up for them a national deliverer, Othniel, the son-in-law of Caleb (ch. 1:13). Othniel is truly an outstanding judge in that no indiscretion or unhallowed deed is recorded of him. On many of the other judges, notwithstanding their victories, fell the shadow of error, of grief, or of a tragic end. When the Spirit of the Lord came upon Othniel, he first judged Israel and then went out to war. This indicates that he put things right among the people before he essayed to fight the enemy. This is as it should be. Sin, the worst of all enemies, needs first to be conquered. Only with this foe subdued can we expect victory over the enemies abroad. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
We do not conquer by sitting still even if the Spirit of the Lord has come upon us. Action is required by those who have the presence of God’s Spirit with them. The Spirit of the Lord is the originator of everything good and of all great achievements, but He works through human agencies. No details are given of Israel's war against King Cushan-Rishathaim, but it must have been a struggle of no mean magnitude considering the status of the oppressing king. However, now that the Lord was again helping the Israelites, their efforts were crowned with victory.</article>

    <shortdescription>The correspondence between the Egyptian court and the kings of Babylonia, Assyria,Mittani, Arzawa, Cyprus, and the Hittites, and of many vassal princes of Syria and Palestine. </shortdescription>
    <article>In 1887 a local woman accidentally discovered the official archive of the kings Amenhotep III and Ikhnaton. It contained more than 350 letters written on clay tablets in Babylonian cuneiform script comprising the correspondence between the Egyptian court and the kings of Babylonia, Assyria,Mittani, Arzawa, Cyprus, and the Hittites, and of many vassal princes of Syria and Palestine.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
These documents, usually referred to as the Amarna Letters, are first-rate sources for the political and cultural history of Western Asia and Egypt during the 14thcentury BC. Among others things are reports of attacks from the ‘Apiru who,according to one of the Canaanite kings, had taken large parts of Canaan. These‘Apiru could be the Hebrews under Joshua and the Judges.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <article>We do not know where in Moab, Naomi and her family sojourned, nor whether they entered Moab from the north or from the south. In any event, the return to Bethlehem meant a descent of about 4,500 ft. (1,372 m.) from the highlands of Moab to the level of the Dead Sea, and an ascent of about 3,750 ft. (1,143.3 m.) to Bethlehem—in a distance of perhaps 75 mi. (120 km.). How fast Ruth and Naomi could travel, and how much they could carry, we do not know. But in those days women were accustomed to travel on foot, and to carry much heavier loads than women of Western lands would think of trying to carry now.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Though Naomi had been absent for perhaps ten years, she still had many friends and relatives in Bethlehem. This was, after all, her home. In Bible times any town surrounded by a wall was called a “city”—even though it might be very small by modern standards (see Joshua 6:1–3). Joshua enumerates 124 such “cities” (ch. 15:21–62). Bethlehem apparently had a wall around it, for mention is made of a gate where the official business of the city was transacted (Ruth 4:1). When she came to the city, people asked, "Is this Naomi?" &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The question the townsfolk of Bethlehem asked does not necessarily infer that they had difficulty in recognizing her, though the experiences through which she had passed may have appreciably affected her appearance. In her reply Naomi spoke of the bitterness (v. 20) of her affliction (v. 21), particularly with respect to the fact that she “went out full” and returned “home again empty” (v. 21). Naomi was not so much concerned with material possessions as with the fact that she returned alone. Therefore when the townsfolk asked, “Is this Naomi?” they were in effect exclaiming, “Is this Naomi, returning alone, as a widow?” It seemed incredible that not only her husband but also both sons had died.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "union." He is the son of Gera and judge of Israel. When Israel fell into apostasy, Eglon, king of Moab, oppressed them for 18 years. They cried out to God and the Lord raised up Ehud who killed Eglon &amp; brought 80 years of peace to Israel.</shortdescription>
    <article>A descendant of Benjamin through Gera, described as left-handed. He assassinated Eglon, king of Moab, who had oppressed Israel for 18 years, and became one of the early judges of Israel. He gained access to Eglon as a tribute bearer and succeeded in having all royal attendants removed on the pretext that he had a secret message for the king. He used this opportunity to kill the king, who is described as being “very fat,” and then called up Israel to shake off the foreign yoke. In the ensuing war many Moabites lost their lives. After Ehud’s deliverance the southern part of Israel had rest for an extended period of time (Jgs 3:15 to 4:1).</article>

    <shortdescription>The Israelites once more turn away from God. The Lord strengthens Eglon, king of the Moabites, to oppress the children of Israel for 18 years. Then they cry to the Lord and God raises up Ehud, from the tribe of Benjamin, to deliver them.</shortdescription>
    <article>Upon the death of the faithful judge Othniel, the Israelites gradually succumbed to their propensity for idolatry. Thus it is seen how powerful the presence of one good man in a church or state may be. When Othniel was gone and the nation had returned to its sinful ways, God allowed other peoples to oppress the Hebrews again. The oppression was designed to be salutary and came from King Eglon. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Moabites were close relatives of the Hebrews (Gen. 19:36–38). Prior to this time the two peoples had never engaged in active warfare with each other. Eglon allied himself with the Ammonites (whose kingdom lay to the north of Moab) and with the Amalekites (migrant Bedouins to the south). The first attack of Eglon was launched against Jericho, the city of palm trees and resulted in his conquering that city and the territory of Benjamin round about.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
After serving this foreign king for 18 years the Israelites became sufficiently weary of their status to realize again that their troubles were due to their religious apostasy, and with a degree of contrition they cried to God for help. Although they had betrayed His trust once, God responded by raising up a deliverer for them from the tribe of Benjamin. The first judge had been from Judah, the leading tribe. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Now Judah seemingly has no champion for the oppressed people. At least the Lord used a man from the smallest tribe, the tribe that had borne the brunt of the Moabite oppression. Ehud, whom the Lord chose as deliverer, is described as left-handed (literally, “bound as to his right hand”). This fact has a bearing on what follows, for a left-handed person would bind his dagger on the opposite side to that on which it was usually carried, a distinct aid in concealing the weapon.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
After having delivered the tribute Ehud and the Israelite carriers who were with him departed for home. When they were a safe distance away, Ehud sent the porters on while he returned to try to carry out his dangerous mission. Ehud supposedly came back to deliver a secret message. The pretext appeared valid, and the king probably accepted it without suspicion inasmuch as Ehud had brought the tribute and the king probably supposed that he was about to betray some secret concerning conditions among the Israelites. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Naturally Ehud could not have been expected to deliver such a message at the earlier public audience. The king's attendants were dismissed. When Ehud came forward, being left-handed helped prevent the king from getting suspicious as he reached under his robe to remove the dagger. The mighty thrust pierced the monarch’s abdomen with such force that the whole dagger disappeared from view. The king’s extreme obesity, probably due to lasciviousness and luxury, rendered him incapable of defending himself. Since the door was locked, Ehud was able to escape and not get caught.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "hewer" or "feller." He is the son of Joash of the family of Abiezer. He is from Ophrah in western Manasseh and becomes a judge and deliverer of Israel against the Midianites. God calls him and he lays out a fleece to confirm this calling.</shortdescription>
    <article>Gideon. A judge and deliverer of the Hebrews, son of Joash of the family of Abiezer, living at Ophrah in western Manasseh (Jgs 6:11). During an oppression by the Midianites, Gideon, while threshing wheat in the wine press at Ophrah to hide his harvest from the Midianites, was called by an angel of the Lord to deliver Israel. He responded with a sacrifice, and the following night threw down the local altar of Baal and built one dedicated to Yahweh (Jgs 6:12–27). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The enraged local inhabitants protested violently and demanded Gideon’s death, but his father defended him by insisting that Baal should be able to defend himself. It was this event that won for Gideon the name Jerubbaal. Later, when the word “Baal” was abhorred, this name was changed to a Jerubbesheth.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
After having received his divine appointment Gideon summoned the men of Manasseh, Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali for an attack against the Midianites (Jgs 6:33–35). Then, becoming fearful, he requested a confirmation of his divine call, which was granted him (vs 36–40). So that the people might recognize that the victory would not be the result of human resourcefulness or strength, God directed that the fighting forces be reduced, with the result that all but 300 men were eliminated. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
With the 300 men, blowing their horns, shouting, and breaking the jars in which they had concealed torches, Gideon attacked at night. Caught by surprise, the Midianites fell into confusion, every soldier fighting his fellow soldier, and then the army fled. The Ephraimites, instructed by Gideon to block the escape routes at the Jordan, caught two of the Midianite princes and sent their heads to Gideon. Gideon continued the pursuit across the Jordan, capturing and killing two more Midianite princes (chs 7:1 to 8:21). This notable victory later became known as the “day of Midian” (Is 9:4 cf. 10:26 Ps 83:11).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Gideon refused the people’s offer to make him king, recognizing that God was their only king (Jgs 8:22, 23). He acted foolishly, however, by making an ephod of the jewelry brought by the Israelites, displaying it in his hometown of Ophrah. This ephod became an object of worship and a means of seduction to idolatry (vs 24–27). He had a large harem and seems to have lived on a grand scale. After a judgeship of 40 years, he died at an advanced age and was buried at Ophrah (vs 28, 32). After Gideon’s death Abimelech, his son by a concubine, slew all but one of the sons of Gideon and made himself king (vs 30, 31 ch 9:1–6).</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "God is exalted." He is a descendant of Ithamar, the youngest of Aaron's sons. He is high priest and judge in Israel near the end of the time of judges and has two wicked sons. Samuel speaks as a child about their fall.</shortdescription>
    <article>Eli. A high priest, descended from Aaron’s youngest son Ithamar (1 Sa 1:9 1 Ki 2:27 1 Chr 24:3, 6). He had become high priest of the tabernacle at Shiloh toward the end of the period of the judges, being the first of his line to hold that office, according to Josephus (Ant. v. 11. 5 viii. 1. 3). It is not certain which of Eleazar’s descendants was his predecessor, or why the office was changed from one family to the other. Eli also occupied the office of judge for 40 years (1 Sa 4:18). His two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, who also were priests, were extremely wicked (ch 2:12–17). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Because Eli failed to deal firmly with their misconduct, an unnamed prophet denounced his house and predicted its downfall (vs 23–36). Later the boy Samuel, who lived at the tabernacle and ministered “to the Lord under Eli,” was given a special revelation confirming this message (ch 3:1–18). A partial fulfillment came when Eli’s two sons, who carried the ark to the camp of the Israelites as a hoped-for aid in a war against the the Philistines, were slain in battle, and the ark was taken. Eli, who was then 98 years of age, upon receiving the news fell from his chair, broke his neck, and died (ch 4:1–18). The final fulfillment came when Solomon removed Abiathar, Eli’s descendant, from the high priesthood (1 Ki 2:26, 35). Thereafter, the descendants of Eleazar held the high priesthood.</article>

    <shortdescription>The Canaanites under King Jabin oppress the Israelites for 20 years. Israel "did evil" in God's sight, but they repent and cry out for help. God raises up Deborah who helps Barak attack Sisera. Jael drives a tent peg through Sisera's head.</shortdescription>
    <article>Following the 80 years of peace that ensued after Ehud broke the Moabite oppression, the Israelites grew careless in their spiritual life and again forsook their God. To awaken His people, the Lord allowed the Canaanite ruler commanding the strong chain of fortresses in northern Palestine to oppress the northern Hebrew tribes for a period of 20 years. The story of how this yoke of oppression was broken by Deborah and Barak is told twice, once in prose form in ch. 4 and again in poetic form in ch. 5.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The book of Joshua mentions a Jabin as king of Hazor (Joshua 11:1-9). The city was captured by the Israelites at that time, but it had probably since been retaken by the Canaanites before the Israelites could consolidate their position in this region. Another Jabin, possibly the grandson of the king Joshua had destroyed, now held a loose suzerainty over the entire Canaanite forces of northern Palestine. Jabin had turned supervision of his forces over to a field commander by the name of Sisera. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This general may have been a king in his own right, ruling over the city in which he dwelt. Harosheth was 16 mi. northwest of Megiddo, where the plain of Jezreel narrows down before joining the coastal plain of Acre. The plain represented a natural terrain for Sisera’s formidable task force of 900 chariots of iron (ch. 4:3). Against such a threatening foe the Israelites, in their state of sinful rebellion, could not stand, and they were soon overcome and forced to pay tribute.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Deboarah, a prophetess was raised up by God. Of the judges whose exploits are recorded in this book she is the only one mentioned as possessing the prophetic gift. Some have thought the phrase “wife of Lapidoth” should be translated “woman of fiery spirit,” which indeed may not have been too inapplicable an appellative in the light of the sequel. Perhaps not as a princess by any civil authority conferred upon her, but as a prophetess, correcting abuses and redressing grievances. Literally, “she sat,” that is, on the judge’s seat. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Her favorite place for hearing cases was under a tree between Ramah and Bethel (see on 1 Sam. 1:1). This seems to have been in the vicinity of the famous “tree of mourning,” under which Rachel’s nurse, Deborah, was buried (Gen. 35:8). This type of courtroom allowed people the freest access to her, and thither they “came up to her for judgment.” She helped lead Israel to victory over the Canaanites and God brought rest on the land. How fitting it would have been if the people, in this period of rest, had walked in the ways of the Lord. There is a lesson for the church of God today. In this time of comparative peace, we are challenged to live up to the light of present truth, and thereby hasten the finishing of God’s work and the consummation of the glorious destiny of the remnant people.</article>

    <shortdescription>After the death of Gideon the people of Shechem make his son Abimelech king. He rules over them for 3 years, before turning against them and destroying the city.</shortdescription>
    <article>Shechem means "shoulder" and was a Canaanite city in central Palestine, the home of Abimelech, the son of Gideon. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Shechem  Situated 30 mi. north of Jerusalem in a narrow fertile valley. It probably had been under the jurisdiction of Gideon. At least it was the residence of Gideon’s concubine and her kinsmen. As soon as Gideon was buried, Abimelech went to Shechem to try to induce his relatives, who seem to have been prominent citizens of the town, to help him obtain the same governing authority as his father had exercised. When later the leaders of Shechem got tired of him and he fought against the city and destroyed it.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "whom God sets free." He is the son of Gilead and referred to as a son of a harlot. His brothers drive him away, but when the Ammonites oppress Israel, he is called into service. After a slaughter, he dedicates his only daughter to God.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jephthah. He was a Gileadite in a double sense: (1) he was a native of Gilead, and (2) his father’s name was Gilead. Because he was an illegitimate child his brothers, who seem to have belonged to the elders of Gilead, expelled him from his home and forced him to flee into the country of Tob, possibly somewhere in the northeast, where he lived as chief of a band of other outcasts (Jgs 11:1–3). He probably raided caravans or extracted tolls from caravans as protection money for safe passage through the territory controlled by his band. The fact that he was later called to become a military leader of the Transjordan tribes shows that he had gained fame in matters of warfare.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
During Jephthah’s exile the Ammonites moved into Israelite territory, occupied it, and oppressed the Israelites for many years. Finally the eastern Israelites recalled Jephthah and placed him as judge and general over them to free them from the Ammonites (Jgs 11:4–11). He invited the Ephraimites to help but seems to have received no response (ch 12:2). He attempted to negotiate with the Ammonites to induce them to end their unlawful occupation of Israelite territories. But these efforts failed so he began military action that resulted in the defeat of the Ammonites and the restoration of the occupied territories to Israel (ch 11:12–27). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Before the battle he rashly vowed that if given victory he would offer as a burnt offering to the Lord the first member of his household to meet him on his return (vs 30, 31). Returning victoriously, he was greatly dismayed to be met by his only child, a daughter. According to the narrative he “did with her according to his vow” (vs 34–40), although some commentators attempt to explain that he simply devoted her to perpetual virginity.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jephthah had trouble with the Ephramites, who complained that they had been slighted when he made his preparations for the Ammonite campaign. He denied this, but civil war broke out between Ephraim and the Transjordan tribes. Jephthah again emerged as victor (Jgs 12:1–6). He judged Israel for 6 years (v 7). He is referred to by Samuel as proof of the faithfulness of the Lord in sending Israel deliverers at the right time (1 Sa 12:11). In Heb 11:32 Jephthah is praised as a man of faith.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "heard of God." He is the son of Elkanah and Hannah who is barren and prays for a miracle. Eli assures her God has heard her prayer. Samuel grows to become one of the greatest prophets of Israel after Moses.</shortdescription>
    <article>Samuel. The 1st of the great prophets of Israel after Moses, being placed side by side with the great lawgiver Moses by Jeremiah (Jer 15:1). His father Elkanah was a Levite of the family of Kohath (1 Chr 6:26, 33, 34) who lived in the territory of Ephraim and therefore was also called an Ephraimite (1 Sa 1:1). His home town was Ramathaim-zophim, also called simply Ramah (chs 1:1, 19 2:11). Elkanah had 2 wives, Hannah and Peninnah. The former was his favorite wife, but she was barren (1 Sa 1:2, 7, 8). After much heart searching and prayer, Hannah vowed that if God would give her a son she would dedicate him to God as a Nazirite. God heard her prayer and she gave birth to a son whom she named Samuel. After he was weaned she took him to the high priest Eli at Shiloh to have him trained in the Lord’s service at the tabernacle (1 Sa 1:9–28).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
At Shiloh, Samuel lived in a room connected with the sanctuary and in close proximity to the room of the high priest. He was dressed in a simple linen ephod, a garment worn by priests and Levites, and performed simple duties such as opening the doors of the sanctuary in the morning (1 Sa 2:18 3:1, 3, 4, 15). While he was still a boy, 12 years of age according to Josephus (Ant. v. 10. 4), the Lord revealed to him the doom that would overtake Eli’s house for the criminal behavior of the high priest’s sons, and for the failure of their father to correct them (ch 3:1–18).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Samuel became a leader, prophet, and judge of Israel. He was a great man. The New Testament lists him with the heroes of faith (Heb 11:32). He revealed himself as a political leader, who regained for his people independence and liberty, and who was able to retain it during the long period of his successful administration. He was in communion with God from his childhood and constantly acted according to divine directions. As a judge he was held in high esteem by the people for his impartiality, loyalty, and honesty. As the founder of the kingdom of Israel, he showed humility and prudence by stepping aside when the people demanded a new leader. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
On the other hand, he was a man who permitted no compromise when the honor of God was at stake, or when a direct command of the Lord had not been carried out. His bloody severity against Agag (1 Sa 15:33) is an illustration of this. Yet, Samuel had a warm heart. He constantly prayed for his people (ch 12:23) and could not cease to love Saul even after he had been forced to reject him as king. Unfortunately, his sons did not follow in his footsteps (ch 8:3).</article>

    <shortdescription>Samuel "ministered before the Lord, even as a child" (1 Sam. 2:18) and later gives his prophecy as a child speaking against the wickedness of Eli's sons (3:18-21).</shortdescription>
    <article>When Samuel was a child, he was given to serve the Lord at the temple and lived with Eli. One night he came to Eli three times when he though the priest called him. The third time the aged priest perceived that it was God who spoke. That the Lord should pass him by to communicate with a mere youth might easily have created in his heart a spirit of professional jealousy. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Remembering the message of the man of God in past years, however, Eli may have concluded that the message was for him and could have reasoned that the Lord should have revealed it to him directly. Eli’s honesty in dealing with Samuel under these conditions is greatly to be admired. Realizing, perhaps for the first time, that God was preparing another to fill his office, he felt no grudge, but on the contrary did his utmost to prepare Samuel for his important post by giving the lad the best counsel he had. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Samuel was instructed to think of himself as the Lord’s servant, ready to hear His counsel and to do His bidding. What a lesson in Eli’s experience for those who are fearful lest they do not receive the honor their office demands, and lest the hands of other men replace theirs at the tasks required of that office&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Since it was a new experience for young Samuel, the Lord graciously manifested His presence in some definite way not described in detail. Ere a word was spoken, both the old priest and his young assistant had ample proof of the presence of a supernatural power, and like children instructed by their parents, both were brought by the Holy Spirit to the place where they were willing to listen and obey. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Such would not have been true had the word of the Lord come to such as Hophni. The question may well be asked: Why did the Lord not speak to Eli directly? Eli seems to have been a sincere, humble man, one who desired peace and righteousness above all else. Why, therefore, bring Samuel into the case? But God no longer communicated with Eli and his sons.</article>

    <shortdescription>Samuel is one of the greatest judges of Israel after the time of Moses. He begins his work as a child and dies in old age during the time Saul is pursuing the life of David. He is buried in Ramah. Samuel is Israel's judge, priest, and prophet.</shortdescription>
    <article>Samuel made a notable contribution when he organized schools for the youth, so that Israel could be trained in the great principles of salvation. God’s original plan was that the Levites should be scattered throughout the whole land, teaching the people concerning the things of God. But being largely unemployed, the members of this tribe were forced to find a livelihood in other kinds of work, with the result that the people were fast becoming little better than the heathen about them. As a result the schools of the prophets were instituted.</article>

    <shortdescription>Israel, during the time of Samuel, fights the Philistines and loses. They decide to bring the ark of covenant into battle and lose again. The Philistines capture the ark. Eli and his two sons die at this time.</shortdescription>
    <article>The book of Judges states that Israel was in bondage to the Philistines for 40 years (Judges 13:1), during which time Samson judged the land for 20 years (Judges 15:20 16:31). Eli’s judgeship either followed or overlapped Samson’s. Eli functioned as judge for 40 years (1 Sam. 4:18). When Eli became so old as to lose control over state affairs, the Philistines may have felt that the time had come for them to secure control of the hill country. Knowing that the center of government was at Shiloh, they would naturally send their army toward it.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Upon numerous previous occasions God had directed that the armies of Israel go forth into battle with their enemies, and when they did so in response to His command victory was theirs. This time, however, the circumstances were different. The fact that they carried the ark of the covenant into battle (v. 3) and that the Philistines captured it is evidence that the people of Israel, motivated by a false confidence in their own strength, had initiated the attack and expected an easy victory. They went forth into battle, not in humble faith trusting in God, but with pride in their own cleverness and power. When God was with them no enemy could stand before them when He was not, defeat was certain.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "firm" or "a gift." He is the son of Obed and grandson of Boaz and Ruth. Jesse is the father of King David and the ancestor of Jesus Christ. He has eight sons. Jesse's family is from Bethlehem but David later moves his parents to Moab.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jesse. A descendant of Judah, and grandson of Boaz and Ruth (Ruth 4:18–22 Mt 1:2–5 Lk 3:32). Jesse had 8 sons, of whom David was the youngest (1 Sa 17:12–14). The list in 1 Chr 2:13–15 names only 7, but the 8th seems to have been Elihu, who may have died without leaving any progeny (ch 27:18). Jesse also had 2 daughters, or possibly stepdaughters (1 Chr 2:16 cf. 2 Sa 17:25). Jesse and his family lived at Bethlehem when Samuel, by divine command, came to anoint David as future king of Israel (1 Sa 16:1–13). Later, when fleeing from Saul, David, fearing for the safety of his relatives, took his parents to Moab and placed them under the protection of the king of that country (1 Sa 22:3, 4). The Scriptures do not mention Jesse’s death.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "sun," "little sun," "destroyer," or "the strong one." He is the son of Manoah and a judge of Israel for 20 years during a time of oppression by the Philistines. Samson is known for his mighty strength which he loses, but gives his life.</shortdescription>
    <article>Samson. A hero of the late period of the judges, who performed feats of superhuman strength during the Philistine oppression of Judah and Dan shortly before Saul became king of Israel. Although Samson is called “judge,” he is so different in character and action from the other judges that he can hardly be compared either with the major judges—Othniel, Ehud, Barak, Gideon, and Jephthah—or with the minor ones—Tola, Jair, Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Samson’s birth was predicted to the barren wife of Manoah, by an angel of God who at the same time instructed her as to the nature of his upbringing and work. He was to be a Nazirite and as such had to live under certain restrictions (Jgs 13). The family of Samson belonged to the tribe of Dan and lived at Zorah (v 2) in the Shephelah not far from the territory of the Philistines, hence probably felt the brunt of Philistine oppressive rule. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Samson possessed unusual strength with which he was able to perform heroic deeds of extraordinary valor. If his moral character had been commensurate with his strength, God would have used him mightily for the deliverance of His people. As it was, he failed to complete the work of God had given him to do, and finally died in captivity and ignominy.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In spite of Samson’s grave failures, the New Testament lists him among the great heroes of faith (Heb 11:32), possibly because he finally realized his total dependence upon God and called upon Him in his last act of valor. Samson’s death should not be considered suicide, but a self-sacrificing act in fulfillment of his calling. The Samson stories not only give the picture of a chosen instrument of God whose indulgence of weaknesses and passions made it impossible for him to fulfill his calling but also provide valuable information concerning the customs of the judges’ period, of which so little is otherwise known. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
We learn that feasts lasting several days were connected with marriage rites that, on occasion at least, riddles were propounded at these feasts that the father gave his daughter to the bridegroom and that a rejected wife was given to someone else. This account also throws light on how crimes were punished and prisoners treated.</article>

    <shortdescription>The Israelites once more turn away from God and do "evil in the sight of the Lord." God delivers them into the hands of the Philistines who oppress them for 40 years. God then raises up Samson to deliver them.</shortdescription>
    <article>The Philistines have been briefly mentioned by the author of Judges several times previously (chs. 3:31 10:7–11). They were, like the Hebrews, invaders and settlers in Palestine. Philistines, in limited numbers, were in the land as early as the time of Abraham (Gen. 21:32). But their major wave of migration into Palestine probably occurred at the beginning of the 12th century b.c. along with that of other non-Semitic tribes from Asia Minor and the Aegean Islands (see p. 27). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
According to archeological accounts these Peoples of the Sea, as they were called by the Egyptians, were turned back at the gates of Egypt by Ramses III about 1194 b.c. In honor of his success in repelling the invaders, Ramses III built a large temple at Thebes (now called Medînet–Habu) and covered its walls with pictures of the battle, among them being realistic representations of Philistine warriors. After the defeat of the Peoples of the Sea by the Egyptians part of this migration settled in the maritime plain of Canaan, where they largely adopted the religion, customs, and language of the Canaanites.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Hebrews called the Philistines Pelishtim, and their territory, Pelesheth, which word, by the evolution of language, became “Palestine.” The Philistines settled chiefly in the five ancient cities of the plain, Ekron, Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashdod, and Eglon, which became the centers of the Philistine confederacy. From there the Philistines spread out into the Shephelah, and eventually, during the time of Saul, controlled all western Palestine as far north as the plain of Esdraelon and the Sea of Galilee. From the time of Samson they were the main challengers of the Israelites until they were subjugated by David.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Bible says they oppressed Israel for 40 years. There has been a question as to whether this period was prior to, or included, the days of Samson and perhaps extended beyond to the battle of Ebenezer in the days of Samuel (1 Sam. 7:13). Samson was born in the early years of the Philistine oppression. According to some authorities, this oppression was contemporaneous with the Ammonite oppression and judgeship of Jephthah.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "asked of God" or "lent to God." He is the son of Kish, a Benjamite and first king of Israel. When the Israelites demand a king, God lets them have one. Saul reigns about 40 years, becomes jealous of David's victories. He commits suicide.</shortdescription>
    <article>Saul. The first Hebrew king. He was the son of the Benjamite Kish, whose home town was Gibeah, now Tell el–Fûl, about 4 mi. (c. 6.5 km.) north of Jerusalem. For centuries Israel had been living under a theocratic form of government, being ruled by judges called by God. The last of these, Samuel, had grown old, and his sons did not measure up to the qualities of leadership of their godly father. The people, having become tired of the lack of continuity in strong leadership, thought that a kingship would provide them with a form of government that would cure their political and international ills. Samuel looked upon the popular demand for a king with extreme disfavor, but God directed him to accede to the people’s desire, at the same time to make them thoroughly acquainted with the disadvantages and burdens this move would bring upon them (1 Sa 8).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
(1) Saul becomes king. Shortly after the people’s demand for a king, Saul, a young, handsome man of towering stature, was out with a servant searching for some lost asses belonging to his father. After a fruitless search of 3 days the servant suggested that they should consult “the seer,” by which he meant Samuel. Although Saul had probably heard of Samuel, he did not know him personally (1 Sa 9:18), and was afraid to approach him without a gift of money (v 7). Meanwhile Samuel had received instruction from God that a Benjamite would come to him whom he should anoint as king. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When Saul arrived, a specific word came to him that Saul was the man who should rule over God’s people. Samuel met him in the gate, assured him that the asses had been found, and invited the surprised Saul to stay for a sacrificial meal. Saul spent the night with Samuel as the prophet’s guest, and in the morning Samuel secretly anointed him and prophesied certain experiences that Saul would have on his way home, which took place as predicted. As soon as Samuel knew who the new king was to be he summoned the whole nation to Mizpah, probably the modern Tell en–Na?beh, where lots were cast publicly to confirm Saul as king.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
(2) Saul’s reign. Paul gives the total length of Saul’s reign as 40 years (Acts 13:21), as does Josephus (Ant. vi. 14. 9). Saul carried out military campaigns with brilliant results (1 Sa 14:47, 48). During one of these campaigns he committed an act of disobedience that sealed his rejection by God as king. He had been ordered to destroy the Amalekites and their possessions, to fulfill a curse pronounced against them by God for having fought against Israel in the wilderness at Rephidim (Ex 17:8–16). Saul carried out the order, but spared some of the cattle, to sacrifice, as he said, at Gilgal, and their king Agag. For this disobedience to a specific command Samuel declared that God no longer considered him as the legitimate ruler of His people (1 Sa 15). A little later Samuel secretly anointed David the shepherd boy to be the future king of the nation (ch 16:1–13).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
(3) Saul’s last years. God’s Spirit departed from Saul when he was rejected as king, and an evil spirit periodically plagued him. In an effort to lift him from his melancholy moods his servants introduced to him young David, who was chosen to play the lyre before the king (1 Sa 16:14–23). At first Saul liked David, but his affection soon changed to jealousy and fear when David, having killed Goliath, and thus secured a victory for the Israelites over the Philistines, was acclaimed by the maidens of Israel as the greatest hero of the nation (chs 17:1 to 18:9). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
His jealousy led him to attempts on David’s life. The result was a weakening of the nation’s defenses and a re-invasion by the Philistines, who this time encamped at Shunem, near the Valley of Jezreel. Having been forsaken by God and being possessed by an evil spirit, he felt driven to seek the help of these tools of the devil. He asked that Samuel, who had died some time before, be brought up by the medium, so that the prophet, who during the last years of his life had not communicated with Saul, might advise him. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The medium claimed to see and old man coming up, and Saul supposed him to be Samuel. The spirit then predicted that Saul would die the next day (1 Sa 28:5–25). The battle on the following day went against the Israelites, and 3 sons of Saul were killed and Saul was badly wounded. Seeking to avoid capture by his enemies, Saul asked his armor bearer to kill him. When the man refused, Saul fell upon his sword and ended his own life.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "God has given." Eldest son of King Saul and commander of the army. Jonathan makes a surprise attack on the Philistines and brings great victory. His father almost kills him. He is David's best friend. He dies with his father in Gilboa.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jonathan. The eldest son of King Saul (1 Sa 14:49), and commander of an army corps (ch 13:2). He smote a Philistine garrison stationed at Geba, and as a result, precipitated war between Israel and the Philistines. He then made a surprise attack on the Philistines at Michmash, which created such confusion in their camp that Saul won an easy victory. In the ensuing pursuit Jonathan ate some wild honey, and thus unknowingly broke a prohibition of his father that no one, under penalty of death, should eat anything during the pursuit of the enemy. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This nearly cost Jonathan’s life, but the people intervened and prevented Saul from killing his son (chs 13:3–7 14:1–46). When David slew Goliath, Jonathan became a friend of the valiant shepherd boy from Bethlehem (ch 18:1–4). Their friendship grew deeper as the years went by, in spite of the enmity of Saul against David. This unselfish friendship almost cost Jonathan his life when Saul in a fit of anger threw a javelin at him for defending David, who he knew would become the future king of Israel (1 Sa 19:1–7 20:1–42). Later, when David lived in southern Judah as a fugitive from Saul’s wrath, the two friends had their last recorded meeting (ch 23:16–18). Jonathan perished with his father and two brothers in the battle of Gilboa, in which the Israelites were defeated by the Philistines (1 Sa 31:1, 2 1 Chr 10:1, 2). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
His body, with those of other members of the royal family, was fastened to the wall of Beth-shean. But the men of Jabesh-gilead, in gratitude for having been saved by Saul on an earlier occasion, crossed the Jordan, rescued the bodies, and gave them an honorable burial (1 Sa 31:10–13 1 Chr 10:8–12). David was deeply moved by Jonathan’s death and mourned for him, composing the beautiful elegy recorded in 2 Sa 1:17–27. Jonathan left one lame son, Mephibosheth (or Merib-baal), to whom David showed kindness for Jonathan’s sake (chs 4:4 9:1–13 19:24–30). Jonathan’s descendants of several generations are listed in the Bible record (1 Chr 8:34–40 1 Chr 9:40–44).</article>

    <shortdescription>When Israel demands to have a king "like the other nations," God tells Samuel to anoint Saul, the Benjamite. He is very handsome and tall but is not accepted by everyone. Saul does not immediately assert his kingship but waits for the right time.</shortdescription>
    <article>God had said through Moses that the time would come when the people would ask for a king “like as all the nations” (Deut. 17:14). Perhaps the elders were virtually quoting this text as an excuse for their request. It was evidently God’s plan that Israel should be distinct from surrounding nations, and through the centuries since the Exodus He had accordingly protected and guided them by judges. Had they entered into God’s plan for them, Moses told them, the nations looking on would say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people” (Deut. 4:6). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Relying on the diplomacy of which the Oriental is capable, they now, in opposition to the will of God and without seeking His counsel, made known their shortsighted decision. At first they stated merely that they wanted a king to judge them after the fashion of the world but when Samuel tried to warn them of the curse they were about to bring upon themselves, they added a second reason, “that our king, may … go out before us, and fight our battles” (1 Sam. 8:20). Clarification of the circumstances under which the elders of Israel appealed for a king is given in ch. 12:12: “When ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay but a king shall reign over us.” Josephus confirms the idea that Nahash had been afflicting the Jews beyond Jordan for some time, reducing their cities to slavery and putting out the right eyes of his captives in order that they might be useless in future warfare (Antiquities vi. 5. 1).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
God sought to demonstrate a unique method of coping with international problems, but Israel saw no way out other than to copy the nations about them. For centuries they had been a seminomadic people, living mostly in tents they had failed to drive the native inhabitants of Canaan from their cities (Judges 1:27–36). Nevertheless, in the years between 1200 and 1050 b.c. they settled increasingly in towns. Now, in perversity of mind they saw nothing to do but to consolidate their government and fortify themselves against the invaders.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Why did God choose Saul as king, knowing full well the life he would lead? The context reveals that the people wanted a man of commanding personality who would provide them with strong leadership in war (ch. 8:19, 20). God chose someone in harmony with their wishes, to prove to them: (1) that He did not limit their freedom of choice, (2) that in spite of their unwise choice He would restrain the evil influences that came with the monarchy, (3) that they must learn by experience that what a man sows he must also reap, and (4) that national departure from the path of God’s choosing does not prevent individuals within that nation from living in harmony with His will and receiving His blessing.</article>

After the battle of Gilboa, in which Saul and 3 of his sons lost their lives, Abner, Saul’s general, made Ish-bosheth king over the northern tribes, who did not join Judah in accepting David as their king. He was about 40 years of age when he began to reign and reigned two years (2 Sa 2:10). He made his headquarters at Mahanaim in Transjordan doubtless because of the hostility of the Philistines (vs 8, 9). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
His efforts to reunite the country by force were unsuccessful (vs 12–17 ch 3:1). Soon, too, he lost his strongest supporter, Abner (ch 3:6–11), whom he accused of serious misdemeanor. Abner thereupon negotiated to transfer the whole northern kingdom to David (vs 12–21). During the negotiations Abner was assassinated by Joab (v 27), and Ish-bosheth gave up hope of retaining his power. Shortly afterward Ish-bosheth was murdered by 2 of his own army officers, who took his head to David in expectation of a reward. David ordered them to be executed instead, and buried Ish-bosheth’s head in Abner’s grave at Hebron (ch 4:1–12).</article>

    <shortdescription>Jonathan, son of Saul, takes his armorbearer to a Philistine garrison. He seeks a sign from God when he appears before some of the men, and the Lord delivers about 20 of them into his hand. The resulting confusion leads to victory for Saul's army.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jonathan did not depend so much on his armor as on the unlimited power of God. He simply used that which he had at hand, and God blessed his humble dependence on Heaven. Even if the king should turn aside from the path of obedience, God proposed to prove to all Israel that salvation is a matter of individual choice and action, and not so much a mass movement. How tragic the situation would have been had God rejected all Israel when the king chose not to obey.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Josephus thinks that it was at break of day that Jonathan and his armor-bearer approached the Philistine outpost, and reached it when most of the men were yet asleep (Antiquities vi. 6. 2). The narrative of ch. 14 confirms the idea that it was early morning (see vs. 15, 16, 20, 23, 24–28, 30, 31, 45). Whether the two Israelites waited till night to make the ascent or whether it took them but a few minutes to climb the precipice is not stated. They evidently took the fortress completely by surprise, for the utmost confusion reigned in the Philistine garrison.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Saul’s impetuosity was developing rapidly. The apparent confusion in the enemy’s camp threw him into such excitement that he could not even wait for counsel from the Lord. For days he and his fellows had stood by and heard reports of raids by the enemy upon nearby towns, and though he did not know the reason for the flight of forces across the wadi, he abruptly gave the order to attack. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Had he taken time to seek divine guidance, he would probably have avoided many of the problems that confronted the army of Israel during the next few hours, and his victory over the enemy would have been far more complete. Clearly, this was a case of haste making waste. Jesus’ times of meditation and of prayer brought Him the calm judgment necessary to endure with patience the ordeal awaiting Him Jacob’s night of wrestling with the angel at Jabbok strengthened him not only to face Esau but to face the years of perplexing problems that followed.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "beloved." He is the youngest son of Jesse of Bethlehem and the greatest of Israel's kings. He reigns for 40 years (7 in Hebron and 33 in Jerusalem). David was a poet and musician. Most of the book of Psalms is attributed to him.</shortdescription>
    <article>David. The son of Jesse, a Bethlehemite, second king of Israel (reigning from c. 1011 to 971 b.c.), and an ancestor of Christ. David’s youth. David, the youngest son of Jesse (1 Sa 16:10–13 17:12–14), is described as a ruddy, handsome boy with beautiful eyes (ch 16:12, RSV). Like many other Palestinian boys, he was early placed in charge of the family’s few sheep (ch 17:28). As shepherd boy he showed unusual bravery by killing a bear and a lion single-handed (vs 34–36). After Saul’s rejection as king, God directed Samuel to anoint David king. This ceremony was carried out in secrecy (ch 16:1–13), and its true significance may not have been understood even by the members of David’s family.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As Saul’s courtier. Saul, plagued by fits of melancholy after the departure of God’s Spirit from him, was counseled to seek relaxation in music. David, a skillful lyre player, was chosen to soothe Saul’s troubled mind. Saul liked the boy and made him also an armor bearer and kept him at the court much of the time, though not continuously (1 Sa 16:14–23 1 Sa 17:15). This must have been of great educational value for the shepherd boy who was destined to become the future king of Israel. In a war with the Philistines about this time, the eldest three sons of Jesse followed Saul’s call to arms and left for the battlefield, about 15 mi. (c. 24 km.) west of Bethlehem. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Here a Philistine champion, Goliath, challenged the Hebrews to appoint an opponent, but the challenge remained unanswered and for about 6 weeks the two hostile armies faced each other without being involved in actual fighting (1 Sa 17:1–16). At the end of this period David, who had been at home, was sent to take some provisions to his soldier brothers. Arriving in the Hebrew camp, he heard Goliath utter his challenging call. He was surprised that none of Saul’s soldiers dared to fight the Philistine warrior and offered to do so himself (vs 17–27). His eldest brother considered David’s offer an unwarranted insolence, but the king assented and allowed the youth to accept the Philistine’s challenge. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
David, laying aside the heavy armor that Saul offered him, went out to meet the Philistine giant with the equipment of a shepherd—a sling and a stick. Skillful in handling the sling, from a distance David shot a stone that struck Goliath on his unprotected forehead. He fell, stunned, and David ran and struck off the giant’s head with Goliath’s own sword. Having lost their champion, the Philistines lost heart and fled in panic. Saul no longer allowed David to leave him (1 Sa 18:2), but his attachment to the young man turned to jealousy and hatred when he saw that David was acclaimed as a greater hero than himself.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As a fugitive. With a few faithful followers David left the capital and hid from Saul who almost continually pursued David with the intent of killing him. Eventually, Saul and his sons were killed in a battle. Upon hearing the news of Israel’s defeat, and of the death of Saul and Jonathan, he mourned their death in beautiful poetry (2 Sa 1).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As king of Judah. Abner, Saul’s commander in chief, immediately placed Saul’s son Ish-bosheth on the throne at Mahanaim, east of the Jordan, but the tribe of Judah seceded from Israel and crowned David king at Hebron (2 Sa 2:1–10). This division, with constant wars between the 2 factions, lasted for about 7 1/2 years, until first Abner and then Ishbosheth were assassinated. At this, the tribes left without a king invited David to assume the kingship over the whole nation (chs 2:11 3:6 to 5:5). David was now about 37 years of age and had several wives and sons (chs 5:4, 5 3:2–5).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As king over Israel and Judah. David’s first act as king over all 12 tribes was to conquer Jerusalem from the Jebusites. He made that city the capital of the kingdom and called it the “city of David” (2 Sa 5:6–10). Since Jerusalem lay between Judah and the southernmost of the northern tribes, yet had belonged to neither, the choice of this stronghold as the nation’s capital aroused no tribal jealousies. In several battles with the Philistines, David succeeded in defeating them so completely that they ceased to be a menace to Israel (2 Sa 5:17–25 8:1 21:15–22 1 Chr 14:8–17 18:1 20:4–8). He also waged war against the Moabites, the Aramaeans of Zobah and Damascus, the Ammonites, the Edomites, and the Amalekites (2 Sa 8 10 12:26–31). Victorious in every war, he was able to extend his territories into surrounding areas, and thus increased the nation’s revenues and his personal fame.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Although David did not live a spotless life, and even loaded his soul with heavy guilt (see 1 Ki 15:5), he knew how to repent, and to accept the results of his transgressions without rebellion (2 Sa 12:13 16:10 Ps 51). He was an illustrious king, the founder of a Hebrew dynasty that lasted for about 425 years, a great religious leader, a true servant of God, and an ancestor of the Messiah, who was at once David’s Son and Lord (Mt 22:41–45).</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "given" or "God has given." He is the greatest prophet during David's and Solomon's reigns. David presents plans to Nathan about building a temple. Nathan is the prophet who confronts David over his adultery. He helps Solomon be crowned.</shortdescription>
    <article>Nathan. An outstanding prophet in David’s and Solomon’s reigns. It was to him that David submitted his plans to build a temple. At first the prophet approved but a divine message instructed him that not David but his son was to carry out the building of the Temple (2 Sa 7 1 Chr 17:1–15). Nathan had the unpleasant task of rebuking the king for his sin in the matter of Bathsheba (2 Sa 12:1–15). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
He and the prophet Gad helped David in the organization of the choirs and musicians for Solomon’s Temple (2 Chr 29:25). His sympathies were apparently for Solomon as David’s successor at least Adonijah and his fellow usurpers did not invite him to the feast during which Adonijah planned to have himself proclaimed king. But Nathan heard of it and acted immediately, informing David of Adonijah’s scheme. As a result Solomon was crowned at once. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Thus Solomon owed his crown, partly at least, to Nathan’s watchfulness and activities (1 Ki 1:8–45). The prophet is also known as a biographer of David and Solomon (1 Chr 29:29 2 Chr 9:29), and portions of his historical works are possibly included in those parts of the books of Kings and Chronicles that deal with David and Solomon.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "God is my light." He is a Hittite, one of David's mighty men, and the husband of Bathseba with whom David commits adultery. David tries to cover her pregnancy and eventually has Uriah put the on the front lines where he dies in battle.</shortdescription>
    <article>Uriah. A Hittite soldier, one of David’s “mighty men” (2 Sa 23:39 1 Chr 11:41). Either his name was Hebrew, or Uriyah was the Hebrew rendering of the frequently occurring Hurrian name Ariya. David committed adultery with Uriah’s wife while her husband was taking part in the siege of Rabbah of the Ammonites. In order to hide his crime David had Uriah placed in the front lines in a position where he would be killed in action. His scheme worked, and after Uriah’s death David took Uriah’s wife (2 Sa 11:1–27). He is called Urias in Mt 1:6, KJV.</article>

    <shortdescription>When Samuel is instructed to anoint a new king to replace Saul, he goes to Jesse in Bethlehem. None of the sons presented are right, so he asks if there are any more. Jesse says, "There remains yet the youngest ... he is keeping the sheep."</shortdescription>
    <article>Why does God choose certain men to be His representatives, passing others by? What difference was there in His choice of Saul and His choice of David? Being omniscient, God knew precisely the course Saul would take, yet anointed him and promised to be with him (ch. 10:7). Contrary to their own best interests and to His will for them, God answered the demand of the people for a king. It is clear that Saul was popular with the people—a king after their heart, but not God’s. They were not thinking of spiritual leadership but of national strength. When chosen, Saul had serious handicaps. God recognized these, yet forewarned him of the dangers he would meet, and gave him definite counsel on how to meet them.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
With David the case was different. There is no evidence that the people had become dissatisfied with Saul in fact they were entirely satisfied with the results of the Amalekite campaign. David was the youngest in his father’s house, and in the Orient age carried with it respect and priority (Gen. 29:25, 26). He was a stripling, with no claim to recognition even from the members of his own household (1 Sam. 17:28). He did not have the lofty stature of Saul, nor the physique of Samson. Saul was called from the plow in response to the urgent pleas of the elders for a king. He had little time for training. David was called from tending sheep, while yet a lad, and had more than a decade in which to prepare for his arduous tasks as leader of the twelve tribes.</article>

    <shortdescription>Saul grows to become great in his own eyes. He is given instructions to utterly destroy the Amalekites which he does not do. He excuses his behavior, blames the people, and tries to look good. Samuel tells Saul God has rejected him as king.</shortdescription>
    <article>Saul began to struggle with pride as the first king of Israel. Saul’s decision to follow his own desires did not in the least thwart God’s eternal purpose, but it did provide an opportunity for God to demonstrate His long-suffering, in permitting Saul to remain king. In this story Saul does not follow the instructions of God. Samuel was so disappointed and perplexed that he sought the Lord with all his heart to learn the way out of the deplorable situation.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
With an apparent show of great respect, Saul waited expectantly to receive Samuel’s commendation. Like men all through the course of history, Saul was ready to believe that he had carried out the commission given him, merely by performing that part of it that was agreeable to him. He had made a foray against the traditional enemies of Israel, and had returned with Agag as proof of the accomplishment of his mission. The victory monument erected in Carmel is evidence of his self-satisfaction. Like Saul of Tarsus, Saul the son of Kish had no doubt come to believe that acts of his own choosing were performed in harmony with God’s will. But here, of course, similarity between the two ends, for the one knew the will of God and did it not, but the other acted in ignorance (1 Tim. 1:13).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When Samuel confronted Saul for not destroying everything as God commanded, Saul made excuses. Like Adam and Eve, Saul sought to blame someone else. Would not the people now have been as loyal to Saul’s command to destroy everything belonging to the Amalekites as they had been previously in abstaining from food on the day they put the Philistines to rout (ch. 14:24)? For anyone of Saul’s nature and intelligence to seek refuge in such an excuse is clear evidence of spiritual breakdown.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Saul failed in this great final test of character. Even Samuel, who had spent the night in prayer to God on Saul’s behalf, that the sentence of rejection might be reversed was filled with indignation when he saw the evidence of Saul’s rebellion. Because Saul had forsaken the Lord, Heaven abandoned him to the course of his own choosing and Samuel, for his part, “came no more to see Saul until the day of his death” (v. 35). Saul had completely disqualified himself as king by submitting to the desires of the people, by laying upon them the blame for his own wrong decision, and by seeking to assume to himself honor that in fact belonged to God.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Reluctant as Samuel may have been in the first place to give Israel a king, once the king had been selected, Samuel remained loyal to him in spite of his mistakes. To Samuel, as later to David, Saul was “the Lord’s anointed” (ch. 24:10). Samuel’s grief over the course Saul had chosen is evidence of the sincerity of Samuel’s solicitude for him.</article>

    <shortdescription>After Saul is rejected as king, Samuel goes to Jesse and looks over his sons. God indicates David, the youngest, is His choice as the next king over Israel. Samuel anoints him with oil and the Spirit of the Lord comes on David from that day forward.</shortdescription>
    <article>Chosen as a youth, David enjoyed the opportunity of a period of training and testing before he assumed the responsibilities of high office. Where David’s character failed in meeting the divine standards, changes could thus be made before his coronation. God deals similarly with every individual whom He invites to be a member of His kingdom, and particularly with those whom he calls to positions of responsibility. All unconsciously man is tested by the common events of life until finally God can say, “Thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things” (Matt. 25:23). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Thus far David had shown himself to possess youthful vigor, a loving, gentle spirit, and fearlessness born of confidence in divine power. He was uncorrupted by the world, a meditative soul growing up in the quiet seclusion of the hills of Bethlehem. There, herding the sheep like Moses in Midian, he acquired a sense of responsibility and developed qualities of leadership that were to carry him through life.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Spirit of the Lord is no respecter of persons. He gave Saul a new heart and pointed out the pitfalls ahead of him. Yet Saul quickly rejected divine guidance. Now God proposed to guide David as He had tried in vain to guide Saul. As with many of the world’s great leaders, David grew up amid humble surroundings, quietly developing a sterling character under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, who one day would qualify him fully for the part he was to play in the great controversy between good and evil. God’s Spirit “came upon David” at the time of his anointing, even as the Divine Spirit came upon Christ at His baptism (see on Matt. 3:16).</article>

    <shortdescription>When David hears Goliath blaspheme the God of Israel, he is brought before King Saul. David explains how, as a shepherd, he slew lions and bears which attacked his father's sheep. "He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine."</shortdescription>
    <article>When David hears Goliath curse Israel, David was jealous for the good name of Israel and Israel’s God, as Moses had been before him (Ex. 32:12, 13 Num. 14:13–16 Deut. 9:26–29 cf. Eze. 20:9). The inactivity of God’s people in a time of shame and crisis was more than David could endure. Saul had once asked great things of God and had attempted great things for Him. However, pride and self-glory had filled his heart, and now every obstacle appeared insurmountable. In his effort to vindicate himself he had forgotten that with God all things are possible. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
How could God better impress upon him his lack than by letting David rehearse the providential protection that had been over him personally in the past. The Spirit of God once took possession of Saul. Now he would have the opportunity of seeing what he himself might have been had he not rebelled against that Spirit. Again he was in a dilemma. If he refused to let David fight, the army would expect him, as king, to champion their cause. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
If he let David fight, and Goliath killed him, the battle would be lost and Israel would again be in bondage to the Philistines. It was to save his own life and reputation that Saul sent David forth to combat. But the very means Saul used in an effort to save his reputation as king and leader resulted in its loss (ch. 18:6–9). It became apparent that without God, Saul was powerless before his enemies (ch. 14:24 cf. 15:23), and that past victories for which he had personally taken credit were from God.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "high born." He is the Phoenician king of Tyre who has good relations with both David and Solomon. He first shows up in Scripture when providing cedar for David's home in residence. He also helps Solomon with materials for the temple.</shortdescription>
    <article>A Phoenician king of Tyre, who had cordial relations with David and Solomon and whose reign overlapped their reigns (1 Ki 5:1 2 Chr 2:3). Josephus states that he was the son of Abibaal, that he reigned for 34 years, and that he died at the age of 53. He also claims that the Temple of Solomon was begun in the 11th or 12th year of Hiram (Ant. viii. 5. 3 3. 1 Against Apion 1. 17, 18). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
His chronological statements are difficult to reconcile with the Biblical evidence, and all attempts at solution are unconvincing hence it must be assumed that Josephus’ statements are in part erroneous. After the capture of Jerusalem, Hiram furnished David with cedarwood and with masons and carpenters to assist in the building of David’s palace (2 Sa 5:7, 11). When Solomon came to the throne Hiram sent congratulations to the young king (1 Ki 5:1), and later furnished him with cedarwood and skilled workmen to build new palaces and the Temple (1 Ki 5:1–12 9:10, 11 2 Chr 2:3–16). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Solomon also received a gift of 120 talents of gold from him (1 Ki 9:14). For the services rendered, Solomon paid Hiram in wheat, barley, oil, and wines—products of Palestine (1 Ki 5:11 2 Chr 2:15). Hiram found unacceptable 20 towns of Galilee that Solomon offered him as partial reimbursement for his help (1 Ki 9:10–12 2 Chr 8:1, 2). Hiram joined forces with Solomon in organizing trading expeditions to Ophir for precious metal and exotic tropical products (1 Ki 9:26–28 2 Chr 9:21).</article>

    <shortdescription>When the Spirit of the Lord leaves Saul, he is troubled and seeks peace. His servants advise him to find someone to skillfully play the harp. David is brought in and Saul appreciates him so much he requests of Jesse that David stay with him.</shortdescription>
    <article>Saul had rejected the Spirit of God—committed the unpardonable sin—and there was nothing more God could do for him (see on ch. 15:35). It was not that the Spirit of Jehovah withdrew from Saul arbitrarily but rather that Saul rebelled against His guidance, and deliberately withdrew himself from the influence of the Spirit. This must be understood in harmony with Ps. 139:7 and with the fundamental principle of free choice. If God through His Holy Spirit forced Himself upon Saul contrary to his desires, God would be making of the king a mere machine.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Saul was advised to seek relief through musical therapy. The sound of David’s lyre and his chanting of lofty hymns afforded Saul temporary release from the evil spirit that haunted him. As Saul listened to David’s music his wicked feelings of self-pity and jealousy left him for a time, only to return with double power as time went on. With his continued rejection of God’s guidance, he became like the man in Christ’s parable of demon possession (Luke 11:24–26), where “the last state” of such a soul proves to be far “worse than the first.”&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Apparently David’s reputation as a musician and a man of bravery, sound judgment, and tact was already established before his appearance at court and his victory over Goliath. David was probably a youth on the verge of manhood, for a little later, at the time of his encounter with Goliath, he is described both as a “boy,” Heb. na‘ar (“young man,” ch. 17:58), and as a “young man,” Heb. ‘elem (“stripling,” v. 56). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Though it was not generally known that David had been anointed king, nothing could hide the fact that the Holy Spirit, who had taken control of his life in a special way at the time of his anointing (see on v. 13), was successfully preparing him for the important tasks that lay ahead. Even Saul came to honor and respect the naturally attractive personality of David, and to esteem in him those qualities implanted there by the Holy Spirit. Saul recognized the obvious superiority of this promising young man, tacitly admitting the wisdom of God’s choice of a successor to the throne.</article>

    <shortdescription>David comes to check on his brothers who are at war with the Philistines in Sochoh. He hears Goliath's defiant statements and offers to fight the giant. Saul sends him and David, using a sling shot and rock, kills Goliath and gives victory to Israel.</shortdescription>
    <article>For more than a month Goliath made his daily challenge. The fact that during this time the Philistines had made no attempt to outflank the army of Israel implies that since their disastrous defeat at Michmash the Philistines had not been strong enough for a full-scale attack. They were now relying on intimidation and the possibility of victory through single combat. This conclusion is strengthened by their precipitous retreat once Goliath was vanquished.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When David went to see his brothers, he heard the taunts of Goliath. His response was, literally, “Who is the Philistine, this uncircumcised [one]?” David gave emphatic utterance to his disdain for the giant who held Saul and his men in terror. With faith in God, a faith that Saul might also have had, David was not in the least impressed by Goliath’s stature. Had Saul been obedient to God the victory might well have been his own but God could not trust him with victory such as this. Goliath is referred to throughout the chapter as “the Philistine.” David could scarcely hide his contempt for such a braggart. Even his brother’s reproach (v. 28) did not deter him. He heard the story of Goliath from many mouths, and spoke so earnestly that the news was soon carried to Saul.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Saul was impressed with David's courage and offered his own armor. David’s courteous reply, “I have not proved them,” is evidence of (1) his faith in other equipment that he had previously tested, and (2) his reliance on past experience in meeting new situations as they arose (see LS 196). David ascribed to the power of God victory even over wild animals. Danger had developed in him a sanctified courage, and faithfulness in little things had effectively prepared him for greater trusts. He had proved to be a trustworthy shepherd over his father’s sheep now he was called to champion the cause of his heavenly Father’s flock (see Eze. 34:5, 23 37:24 Matt. 9:36 25:33 John 10:12, 13). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The procedure he chose was determined by his own spiritual convictions rather than by the un-sanctified judgment of others, irrespective of position. How much depends upon purity of motive when one is going forth on a perilous enterprise! David could not fight in Saul’s armor—he must be himself. God designs that every man shall work in his own harness. We see a man in public life who takes well with the people, and we copy his mannerisms, hoping to find success through them. But God wants men who will be themselves, men who will learn from each day’s experience what they need to know in order to solve tomorrow’s problems. Thank God for men who dare to use the equipment God has provided them.&lt;BR /&gt;

David, using a sling and stone, conquered Goliath. His victory was over a Philistine who was the very personification of blasphemy. It was a victory of spiritual forces over material brute strength. In view of the events of previous months, how necessary it was that Israel be taught this lesson! In reply to Goliath’s curse, David exultantly cried, “I come to thee in the name of the … God of the armies of Israel” (v. 45). A simple stone from the brook plus a lad’s skill and his confiding trust in the eternal God gave the Israelites a lesson they were never to forget, even though they seldom emulated it.</article>

    <shortdescription>Saul is jealous, angry, and afraid of David's growing popularity in Israel. He arranges for David to marry his daughter and become a son-in-law of the king. Thus, David becomes a brother-in-law of Jonathan who becomes his best friend.</shortdescription>
    <article>In 1 Samuel 18 we see two distinct personalities stand forth in sharp contrast, the cunning duplicity of Saul against the simplicity and straightforward conduct of David. Not only did Saul’s conscience trouble him, but secretly he was also afraid of the people, who loved David and were vocal in their expressions of loyalty to him. Jealous of every word of praise favoring the youth, Saul resorted to double-dealing—the stock in trade of selfish men—open flattery, and secret plotting. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
At first David seems to have been unaware of the snares set for him. He accepted both promotion and demotion in the same spirit of cooperative humility. His heart being pure before God, he was concerned only with the efficient discharge of every task assigned him, and calmly indifferent to personal danger.</article>

    <shortdescription>When David returns from battle, the women sing and dance, saying, "Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands." Saul is very angry. "So Saul eyed David from that day forward" (1 Sam. 18:9).</shortdescription>
    <article>No time interval is given between the announcement of God’s choice of another man, “better than thou” (ch. 15:28), as king, and this present experience of David in the court of the king. Though it is probable that several years had passed, Saul would certainly be on the watch for signs of the man who was to succeed him (see v. 9). He had recently proved powerless before the Philistines, and had it not been for the courageous exploit of this shepherd lad he might have lost his own life. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Yet, he resented the thought that this lad whom he had honored and associated closely with himself might be winning away from him the affections of the people and the army as well. What kind of gratitude would that be? Time had not eased the smart of the prophetic rebuke (see ch. 15:23). Saul again gave way to feelings of discontent and evil surmisings until his jealous mind finally became deranged.</article>

    <shortdescription>Saul persecutes David after another Philistine victory and seeks to pin him to the wall with a spear while David is playing the harp. David's wife tells him to run, and she makes it look like he is in bed sleeping. He escapes to Samuel at Ramah.</shortdescription>
    <article>The narrative does not state how Michal learned of Saul’s command to kill David. She may have seen the officers lying in wait for David, and, knowing the character of her father, perceived his purpose. Or, perhaps, David was impressed to confide in her. Perhaps David was thinking of this experience when he fervently sang, "A man’s goings are established of Jehovah" (Ps. 37:23, ASV). Imagine David out on the mountainside, homeless and hunted like a wild animal! But after a night of weeping David could say, "I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defense and refuge in the day of my trouble".&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
David escapes through a window. The word translated "window" comes from a verb meaning "to bore," "to pierce." Anciently, houses were usually built in such a way that all openings faced a walled-in courtyard, except for one main outside entrance. Often the roofs were flat and could be reached either from the inside of the house or from the courtyard. The record does not state whether the opening through which Michal let down David was onto the roof, or whether it overlooked the rear of the house. In any case it was at some point opposite the front entrance, where the emissaries from the king stood watch. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The spies were let down from the walls of Jericho in a similar way (Joshua 2:15) Paul was let down over the wall at Damascus (Acts 9:25) the disciples opened the flat roof to let the paralytic down in the presence of Jesus (Luke 5:19). The wisdom of Michal’s prompt action became apparent when the officers commissioned to arrest David clamored for admission the next morning.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
There are times when the cause of right can be advanced better by flight than by fighting. Some may think that inasmuch as God had anointed David, and Saul had so far departed from right as to attempt murder, it would have been better for David to stand his ground. Heretofore he had never turned his back to an enemy. Had he faced Saul in the same spirit that he met Goliath, he could not have failed to draw many of the people to his side but such an action would have led to civil war, for Saul was also popular and many obeyed him implicitly. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As events later proved, it was seven years after the death of Saul before David was accepted by all Israel. As with David, so with Christ. Fearless and unafraid, the Saviour could have summoned the armies of heaven to His aid. Instead, He permitted evil men to have their day.  Michal makes it look like David is bed sick and tells Saul's messengers so. He demands they bring him out anyway so he can kill David, but they discover he has escaped.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Thoroughly frightened because of Saul’s attempt on his life, David naturally sought counsel from the one who had called him from the sheepfold to a place of responsibility in Israel, and had, possibly, taught him at Ramah. With Samuel he would feel as safe from Saul as if there had been a sanctuary to which he might flee (see 1 Kings 1:50–53 2:28–34).</article>

    <shortdescription>David flees from Saul who wants to kill him. He goes to Nob where the sanctuary is located and approaches Ahimelech, the High Priest, and asks for food. He gives him the holy bread and Goliath's sword. David is not truthful about his business.</shortdescription>
    <article>There is no question about the fact that David gave Ahimelech a complete misrepresentation of the facts. David was in a place of great danger. He had been so overwhelmed by the turn of recent events that it was difficult for him to view present tests in the light of manifest evidences of God’s call and protective watch-care. If he fled to Samuel, he might endanger the life of that venerable man. If he returned to his own home in Gibeah, his presence might incur the death of his wife. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In the sincerity of his soul he longed to inquire of the Lord, and the only place he could think of was the tabernacle at Nob. Inasmuch as Saul had required the priest to be in attendance upon him in war, it is probable that David, as captain over a thousand (ch. 18:13), had previously stopped at Nob for help before proceeding on his various forays.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
His problem now was to make inquiry without giving Ahimelech any real knowledge of the situation. That the priest did inquire for him seems evident from Doeg’s tale to Saul (ch. 22:10), and Ahimelech’s implied admission of utter ignorance of any trouble between Saul and his son-in-law (ch. 22:14, 15). David found the situation at Nob greatly complicated by Doeg’s presence. It seemed as if everything was against him. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
He needed help, and in the moment of temptation it appeared that the only way to get assistance and at the same time protect the priest was to speak in such a way as to keep Ahimelech from knowing his reason for coming. In this resort to deception David did wrong.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The fact that the Bible here does not condemn David’s duplicity must not be taken as a justification of the act. The Scriptures require strict truthfulness.&lt;BR /&gt;
From the standpoint of the standards of the day David’s dissimulation would be regarded as reasonably defensible. It is said that among the peoples of the Near East it was—and still is to a great extent—believed that it was not a crime to tell a lie to save a life. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Gibeonites resorted to such stratagem, and yet their lives were spared (Joshua 9:3–18). But though God accepted men tainted with the customs of the day, He was trying to lead them on to a higher standard. He did not reject them or forsake them for the occasional or perhaps habitual practice of the customs of the time. It was God’s plan eventually to bring about reform in all these matters.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Although David could not plead ignorance for his act, God did not forsake him. Perhaps it would have been better for him to have gone to Samuel, who was acquainted with the whole matter. God had a thousand ways out of the difficulty. If David had told Ahimelech the truth, the priest would have been forewarned and could have escaped the murderous hand of the king.</article>

    <shortdescription>As David continues to hide from Saul, he goes to the Philistines, King Achish of Gath, probably looking to be a mercenary. But he becomes afraid when they discover who he is, and David pretends to be mad and then escapes.</shortdescription>
    <article>King Achish, to whom David fled when pursued by Saul, is called Abimelech in the title of Ps. 34, Achish being a Philistine name, and Abimelech, Semitic. This psalm was written by David when he feigned madness before the men of Philistia. As an outlaw David could not find help in Israel. It was quite a common occurrence for the outlaws of a nation to be given shelter by the enemies of that nation. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Gath was not far away, perhaps less than 30 mi. from Nob. Saul would hardly think of looking for him there. David was well acquainted with the country where he had obtained the dowry for his wife Michal. If he should confide in Achish, he was sure Saul would not be permitted to take him. In times of great personal temptation and trial, when enemies are exalted and friends are debased, when no matter which way one moves he is deprived of the counsel and help he needs, it is well to review the narrative of David’s escape from Saul, his contact with Ahimelech and Doeg at Nob, and his flight to the enemies of Israel at Gath, and then to read his inspired song of thanksgiving (Ps. 34) thought to have been composed at that time.</article>

    <shortdescription>While running for his life, David flees to the cave of Adullam. His family and others join him and he becomes captain over a small army of about 400 men. These include those who are "discontent" with Saul's reign.</shortdescription>
    <article>According to Josephus (Antiquities vi. 12. 3), the place where David fled from Saul was a cave near the city of Adullam. Adullam has been identified with Khirbet esh– Sheikh Madhkûr, 16 1/4 mi. (26 km.) southwest of Jerusalem on the western slope as the mountains fall off toward the Shephelah. The town is at the eastern end of the Valley of Elah, where David met the Philistine giant. Many caves are found in these hills, some of which are very large. The sandstone formation is so soft that the walls can be cut down with shells. Even centuries have not erased the marks of these shells. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In some of these caverns the shepherds kept their flocks. In some, a few miles south of Adullam, the early Christians are reported to have lived at the time persecution drove them out of the cities of Palestine. Some of the caves contain burial vaults and crypts similar to those in the catacombs at Rome. Adullam was the hiding place of David when he longed for a drink from the well at Bethlehem. Three of his valiant men risked their lives to thread through the lines of the Philistines, who had raided the Valley of Rephaim near Jerusalem, and to bring their beloved leader a drink. So overcome was David by their loyalty that he poured out the water as a libation before the Lord (2 Sam. 23:13–17 1 Chron. 11:15–19). This incident occurred in the time of harvest (2 Sam. 23:13 cf. 1 Sam. 23:1), the spring and early summer of the year. David had probably spent the winter in this cave.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
While in the cave of Adullam David wrote the 57th psalm, according to its heading. Recovering his faith and courage, he now expressed his confidence in God’s deliverance, even though he found himself “among lions: and even among … men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword” (Ps. 57:4). His changed attitude may in part be accounted for by the presence of the prophet Gad, who, as some have suggested, joined David and his companions at the cave (see on v. 5).</article>

    <shortdescription>After David gathers 400 men, Saul hears that Ahimelech gave David bread and Goliath's sword. He has all the priests and their families at Nob murdered. Abiathar escapes and tells David. David invites Abiathar to stay with him for safety.</shortdescription>
    <article>Saul discovers David is back in Judah. Doeg makes an accusation against Ahimelech the priest and a massacre at Nob follows immediately upon the discovery of David’s original escape. Doeg, the chief herdsman, saw his chance to be avenged on the priest Ahimelech (see ch. 21:7), as well as to enhance his position with the king. He virtually told Saul that Jonathan and the Benjamites were not so much in the wrong as the priest, who not only gave David food but inquired of the Lord for him, and gave him a weapon (v. 10). Doeg apparently did not volunteer this information until bribed by offers of rich rewards and high position.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Ahimelech did not deny the charge of aiding David, but he denied any disloyalty. Now that he had permission from the king of Israel, Doeg did not hesitate to lift his hand against the servant of God, even disregarding the sacred vestments of Ahimelech as well as those of his associates. Eighty-five men fell that day before the lust of selfish greed. What a contrast here between Saul’s professed religious fervor that kept Agag alive (ch. 15:20) and his frenzy that enabled him to perpetrate an act unparalleled in Jewish history for its barbarity.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When David heard what happened from Abiathar, he invited him to stay with David. What a joy it must have been for David to welcome Abiathar to his company What encouragement it must have been to see the Urim and the Thummim (ch. 23:6) and to know that in spite of the devastation of Nob, the hand of God had been over the ephod and the priest who guarded it. Yet when David learned the awful facts of the tragedy, he was filled with remorse as he realized that he had been responsible for the death of the high priest and those who had perished with him. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
He now wished that he had refused to stoop to duplicity. Gladly would he have done differently could he have had the year to live over again But the past could not be undone. Dreadful as was his self-reproach there was nothing to do but to reach “forth unto those things which are before” (Phil. 3:13).</article>

    <shortdescription>David consults the ephod and inquires of the Lord whether to stay in Keilah. He then escapes to the Wilderness of Ziph. Jonathan meets David and encourages him. Saul discovers David's location and seeks to kill him, but David escapes once more.</shortdescription>
    <article>David continues to escape Saul. After consulting the ephod, he flees to the Wilderness of Ziph. This district is a barren, sun-scorched desert, full of deep wadies that make excellent hiding places. The “strong holds,” or fortresses, were lookouts commanding large areas of country, and placed near enough together so that it was impossible for anyone to traverse this section without being noticed. Probably David placed his men at various strategic positions, and every day word reached him of the location of Saul’s forces. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Water and food were almost unobtainable. Jonathan heard of David's location and found some means of arranging a meeting with David. Perhaps some of the soldiers sent out on these searching parties gave Jonathan information that was kept from Saul. If so, David would be convinced of sympathy on the part of many. He needed the encouragement that such a visit could give. Although the title of the 11th psalm does not give the time of its composition, its tone of confidence has caused some to feel that after Jonathan’s visit, David expressed his trust in the providential openings of the Lord in its lines (see Ps. 11).</article>

    <shortdescription>Saul pursues David at En Gedi, an oasis on the Dead Sea. When Saul enters a cave to attend to his needs, David and his men are hiding in the recesses of the cave. David cuts the corner of Saul's robe off but does not harm him. Saul goes home.</shortdescription>
    <article>David now flees from Saul to En-gedi, a beautiful oasis on the shore of the Dead Sea, at the mouth of the Wadi el–Kelb—a steep, tortuous canyon beginning back some 8 mi. (12.8 km.) in the white limestone wilderness of En-gedi at an elevation of about 1,200 ft. (368 m.) above sea level. Up in the wadi several hundred feet above the base of a cliff, the beautiful warm spring of En-gedi gushes out from beneath a large boulder at a reported temperature of 83° F. In the sides of the wadi are many caves, both natural and artificial.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Saul enters a cave to relieve himself. Coming from the outside, Saul could see nothing, but the men in the cave could see clearly, for their eyes were accustomed to the darkness. At this point David could have killed Saul, but he only cut off a piece of his garment. This robe was probably the exterior tunic without sleeves, wide, and reaching to the ankles, worn by women, and also by men of high rank, such as kings and priests, etc. Doubtless David’s men recognized the king as much by his dress as by his personal appearance. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Although no record is given of a divine promise that David would have his enemy delivered into his hand, what the men said may, indeed, have been true. The opportunity probably came as a test to David to enable him to exhibit the characteristics he had developed. Had David at this juncture killed Saul, he would have shown that in one respect, at least, he was no better than Saul, who if the circumstances had been reversed, would have delighted to kill David.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "he who scatters shame." He is the son of Jonathan and grandson of Saul. When news of Saul and his sons being killed reaches Mephibosheth's nurse, she picks up the 5-year-old and runs. He falls and is lame for life. David shows him mercy.</shortdescription>
    <article>Mephibosheth, son of Jonathan. He was only 5 years of age when his father and grandfather died in the battle of Gilboa. When the news of this catastrophe reached the court his nurse took him and fled, but during the flight he fell and was lamed for life (2 Sa 4:4). For a time he lived in Transjordan at Lo-debar, but when David learned of his whereabouts he brought him to Jerusalem, and in memory of his friendship to the boy’s father made him a member of the official court family. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
He also restored the estates of Saul and Jonathan to him, placing them under the administration of Ziba, Saul’s former steward (ch 9:3–13). During the rebellion of Absalom, Mephibosheth remained in Jerusalem and was accused by Ziba of having joined the rebellion. Consequently David gave Ziba all the property of his master (ch 16:1–4). Upon David’s return, Mephibosheth defended his innocence, and half of his property was restored (ch 19:24–30). When seven of Saul’s descendants were executed to revenge Saul’s unjustified massacre of the Gibeonites, David spared Mephibosheth for the sake of Jonathan (ch 21:7). Mephibosheth had a son, Mica, through whom Saul’s family was continued (2 Sa 9:12 1 Chr 8:34–40 9:40–44).</article>

    <shortdescription>After David spares Saul's life at En Gedi, he hears of Samuel's death and goes to the Wilderness of Paran. One of the best loved Psalms, 121, was probably written during this difficult time when David lost his earthly moral support and also Michal.</shortdescription>
    <article>After Samuel died, David fled to the Wilderness of Paran, a desert extending from southern Judah south toward Sinai (see Num. 10:12). Paran is in one instance equated with Seir (Deut. 33:2), and Seir was the home of Esau in the Negeb below Hebron (see Gen. 32:3 etc.). The Wilderness of Paran is thought to include the Wilderness of Zin lying between Kadeshbarnea and the great Arabah or plain between the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Aqabah. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Since the tribes inhabiting this region were predatory in nature, David would find a very cold reception as he fled to Paran, and doubtless recognized his mistake. This reception, together with the knowledge that Saul’s enmity would be more bitter after the death of Samuel, made David sense the need of definite help from on high. In his great anxiety he composed the 120th and 121st psalms. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When David realized that his last influential earthly friend was gone, he turned to the Lord for his sole remaining help. Psalm 121 has been a great blessing to countless thousands who at one time or another have found themselves in circumstances more or less similar to those in which the psalmist finds himself.</article>

    <shortdescription>Abigail (sometimes Abigal) is the wife of Nabal, a wealthy shepherd. David's men treat Nabal's shepherds kindly, but Nabal reviles David's men. Nabal learns of his foolishness from Abigail who intercedes for him. He later dies. David marries her.</shortdescription>
    <article>During their stay in the wilderness of Ziph and Maon (ch. 23:24–26), before the removal to En-gedi (ch. 23:29), David and his men had become acquainted with the shepherds of Nabal, and had left a most favorable impression. Living close to the desert, Nabal was constantly exposed to marauding bands. Nabal's name means "foolish" and he lives us to his name in how he treats David. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Though an outlaw himself, so far as Saul was concerned, David had been the protector of his people from the predatory attacks from the desert. He had preserved the flocks of Nabal at no expense to their owner. Sheep owners would normally be happy to reward those helping them against loss. David’s request for supplies was legitimate and in harmony with the customs of his time.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Nabal responds by asking, "Who is David?" Such insulting remarks would scarcely have been made if David had abode still at Maon. The reference to the servants breaking away may be either to David’s breach with Saul or to these young men whom Nabal curtly dismissed with the insinuation that he could not tell whether they were David’s men or not (see v. 11). David made a serious blunder in his hasty decision to seek personal revenge. He had yet to learn the lesson of patience. Abigail heard what her husband did. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
What turn of events attached a woman of such a disposition to such a rash, impetuous man as Nabal is not known, but often two people of diametrically opposite natures are brought together in the most intimate relationships of husband and wife. This was probably not the first time that Abigail had been called upon to act as peacemaker between her husband and his associates. Little did Abigail realize in her daily ministrations to Nabal that she was developing a clearness of spiritual perception and a strengthening of her womanly intuition that would one day enable her to keep David from a serious error (vs. 18–28).</article>

    <shortdescription>David spares Saul's life a 2nd time in the Wilderness of Ziph. At night Abishai and David enter Saul's camp. Abishai wants to kill Saul, but David takes his spear and water jug. He later talks to Saul at a distance. Saul is repentant and they part.</shortdescription>
    <article>When David and Abishai sneek into Saul's camp while everyone is sleeping, Abishai wants to kill Saul. Abishai had not learned the difficult lesson of exercising magnanimity toward an enemy. Saul had started an intertribal feud between Benjamin and Judah, and Abishai evidently concluded that such an action called for retaliation. Saul had thrown his spear at David, but had missed. Now, according to Abishai’s judgment, it was David’s turn, and as his bodyguard, Abishai was offering to act on behalf of his uncle. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
David exercised independent thought. He was above taking any living man as his criterion for conduct. He had developed his philosophy of life, not from tradition, but from the principles laid down in divine revelation. Among the precepts of the Mosaic law, with which David had familiarized himself, was the following: “You shall not revile God, nor curse a ruler of your people” (Ex. 22:28, RSV). David possessed keen spiritual discernment and understood this law to prohibit such action against the king as Abishai advocated. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
David’s spiritual interpretation of the Mosaic regulations was far advanced over that of the Jewish leaders in Christ’s day, who tried to maintain the letter of the law while violating its spirit! David was content to leave all in God’s hands, and in no way try to prescribe the course for God to follow. He gladly laid all his plans at the Master’s feet, to await patiently the unfolding of the mysterious workings of God.</article>

    <shortdescription>After Saul's death, the Philistines hang his body, and his sons', on the wall of Beth Shan. The men of Jabesh Gilead hear what happened and travel all night and take the bodies down and burn them, bury them, and then fast for seven days.</shortdescription>
    <article>Remembering that Saul had wrought so wonderfully for the deliverance of this city, the elders felt it a privilege to do honor to the body of their rescuer. Misfortune, defeat, and death all bring to light the hidden sympathies in the hearts of men, and reveal their noblest sentiments. The inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead demonstrated unabated loyalty to their fallen leader. Having accorded his body and the bodies of his sons a respectable burial, they observed a brief period of mourning.</article>

    <shortdescription>As another war brews with the Philistines at Gilboa, Saul seeks the Lord who does not answer him. So he seeks a witch who supposedly calls up the dead prophet Samuel who then gives bad news. It is an evil spirit who speaks to Saul.</shortdescription>
    <article>The fact that the Philistines could pass clear through the valley to Shunem indicates that while Saul had been so intent on finding David, he had been most remiss in protecting his frontiers, and the Philistines had taken advantage of this laxity. Saul’s mad passion to rid the land of David, had involuntarily opened the whole country to the invasions of the Philistines. The invaders had probably overrun much of the territory belonging to Issachar, Zebulun, and Asher. From the top of Mt. Gilboa, Saul could get a commanding view of the Valley of Jezreel and the opposing army nestled at the base of Moreh some 4 or 5 mi. distant. Perhaps Israelite scouts had intensified Saul’s desperation by warning him concerning David’s presence with the Philistine host, and he feared lest David now seek revenge.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When Saul enquired of the Lord, God did not answer him. The Lord never turns away any soul who comes to Him in humility and sincerity. The answer may not come in the manner expected or at the time expected, but God takes note of the petition and works what is best under the circumstances. The frantic appeals of Saul reached the divine ear, but in view of the situation, God chose not to impart the information the king was seeking. Saul had deliberately refused to wait for God’s counsel at Gilgal (ch. 13:8–14), or to accept any messages contrary to his kingly ideas. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
He had had access to the tabernacle at Nob, but had murdered the priests. Inasmuch as Saul had voluntarily chosen to follow his own counsel, God permitted him to reap the fruit of such sowing. Had he been repentant and submissive, God could have turned his mistakes into steppingstones to success. The text seems to indicate that in his desperation, Saul tried hurriedly to inquire by means of dreams, Urim, and prophets, but all three were silent. Since Abiathar had the ephod in his possession, some think that Saul ordered another made. In his mad haste Saul turned to the source of information he himself had condemned (v. 3). The man who was once filled with spiritual zeal now gave way to the heathen superstition of calling on the supposed spirits of departed souls for help.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "daughter of an oath" or "daughter of the Sabbath." She is the daughter of Eliam and wife of Uriah, the Hittite, who was one of David's soldiers. David commits adultery with her and she becomes pregnant. Uriah is murdered and they marry.</shortdescription>
    <article>Bathsheba. Daughter of Eliam, and wife of Uriah, a Hittite soldier in David’s army. Attracted by her beauty, David committed adultery with her during her husband’s absence, resulting in her pregnancy. When he failed in his attempts to make Uriah visit his home and thus be led later to believe that the child was his, David manipulated events to have his faithful soldier killed during the siege of Rabbah. Following the customary period of mourning, he married Bathsheba. The first child died the second was the later King Solomon (2 Sa 11:1 to 12:24).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When Adonijah was about to assume the royal throne (1 Ki 1:11–31), Bathsheba, advised by the prophet Nathan, induced the king immediately to crown her son Solomon. She tried later to obtain her son’s consent for Adonijah’s marriage to Abishag, David’s nurse. Her efforts failed, and because of the request Adonijah lost his life (ch 2:13–25). According to 1 Chr 3:5 Bathsheba had three sons besides Solomon: Shimea, Shobab, and Nathan (cf. 2 2 Sa 5:14 1 Chr 14:4). Once she is called Bath-shua, the daughter of Ammiel (1 Chr 3:5). The name Bath-shua is a misreading for Bathsheba, probably caused by a partial effacing of the Hebrew letter b. The name Ammiel contains the component parts of Eliam in reverse order. Bathsheba is listed in Matthew’s genealogy of Christ as “the wife of Uriah” (Mt 1:6, RSV).</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "father of peace." He is the 3rd son of David through Maacah and is known for his handsome appearance. He avenges the crime of his half brother against Tamar by having Amnon murdered. Absalom seeks to overthrow his father but dies by Joab.</shortdescription>
    <article>Absalom. Third son of David by his wife Maacah, daughter of Talmai, the king of Geshur (2 Sa 3:3). He was known for his handsome appearance (2 Sa 14:25, 26). To avenge the crime committed by his half brother Amnon against his sister Tamar, he killed Amnon and then fled to his grandfather, Talmai, king of Geshur, to escape possible reprisal from David (ch 13). About three years later, by engaging the services of a wise woman from Tekoa, Joab succeeded in obtaining permission for him to return to Jerusalem. Two years later he reconciled father and son (ch 14).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Shortly after this Absalom began to scheme against his father to obtain the kingship, and had himself proclaimed king at Hebron (2 Sa 15:1–12). Marching against Jerusalem, he forced David to flee the capital and took possession of the royal palace and of the harem. He disregarded the counsel of Ahithophel and did not immediately pursue the small forces of David, but followed, instead, the advice of David’s friend Hushai, who counseled him to mobilize all of Israel’s army before continuing the pursuit. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This gave David time to reorganize his forces and get ready for the decisive encounter (chs 15:13 to 17:23). The battle took place in the “wood of Ephraim,” somewhere in Gilead, probably near Mahanaim. The forces of Absalom were severely beaten and in the confusion of battle Absalom was caught by the head in the branches of a tree, and left hanging helpless. While thus suspended he was killed by Joab against the explicit command of David. He was buried like a criminal in a large pit in the wood, and a big heap of stones was erected over his grave (2 Sa 17:24 to 18:17). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
During his life Absalom had erected for himself a monument, which stood in the “king’s dale” (2 Sa 18:18), and, according to Josephus (Ant. vi. vii 10. 3), was 2 furlongs (c. 402 m.) from Jerusalem. The so-called Tomb of Absalom now standing in the Kidron Valley at Jerusalem is a tomb monument of the Hellenistic period. According to 2 Sa 14:27 Absalom had 3 sons and a daughter named Tamar. The Maachah mentioned in 2 Chr 11:20 and 1 Ki 15:2, 10 as Absalom’s (or Abishalom’s) daughter was probably his granddaughter. The Bible sometimes uses the expression “daughter” for “granddaughter.”</article>

    <shortdescription>After Saul's death David becomes king over Judah. After a civil war and Abner is murdered and Ishbosheth is murdered, the tribes of Israel come to David and ask him to be king over all Israel. David reigns for 40 years, 33 over all Judah &amp; Israel.</shortdescription>
    <article>In 2 Samuel, chapters 5 to 10, the writer deals with the establishment of the kingdom and the early part of David’s reign over the whole nation. Chronicles adds certain interesting details of the manner in which various tribes from both sides of the Jordan came to Hebron to make David king, and of the joyous festivities on that occasion. Not only did the elders come as representatives of the people (ch. 5:3) but numerous bands of armed men participated (1 Chron. 12:23–38), and 4,600 Levites, with Jehoiada as the leader of the Aaronites and Zadok as a “young man mighty of valour” (1 Chron. 12:26–28). The events in Samuel are not arranged with a strict regard to chronology. The writer of this book describes first the internal development of the kingdom, and then the external development of the realm.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
More than perhaps any other people on earth, the Hebrews were bound together by ties of kinship. They were all children of Abraham, all of the same bone and flesh as was David himself (see Gen. 29:14 Judges 9:2 2 Sam. 19:12). The same tie still binds the Jews of all lands. The people were not selecting their new leader blindly. Even while Saul was king the outstanding ability of David as a leader had manifested itself. The people had confidence in his prowess and sagacity. The main reason David should be king was that the Lord had chosen him for that position. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Why the elders mentioned this point last is not revealed. With such a general confidence in the valiant and virtuous son of Jesse, with the house of Saul having practically come to an end, and with the divine will having so clearly manifested itself in behalf of David, it was obviously to the best interests of the people to unite under his leadership. The elders acted as the representatives and spokesmen of the people. With them came many of the warriors and the priests to acknowledge their allegiance to the son of Jesse (1 Chron. 12:23–38). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Many thousands thronged to Hebron for the coronation ceremonies. The details of the agreement are not given, but there was evidently some understanding as to the prerogatives of the king and the rights of the subjects. There may have been reference to such matters as leadership in war, freedom from tribal partiality, political asylum for the remnant of the house of Saul, the size of the national army, and the manner of securing recruits, etc.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jerusalem is held by the Jebusites who mock David's army, saying their blind and lame could hold them off. David's army fights and captures Jerusalem and he makes it the new capital for the nation. David has a house built in the new city called Zion.</shortdescription>
    <article>As soon as David was anointed king over all Israel, he saw the need of a better site than Hebron for his capital. Hebron was in the extreme south of the territory occupied by the Hebrews. He evidently preferred to retain his capital in Judah, and Jerusalem offered an ideal site (see Joshua 15:63 Judges 1:21). Joshua had slain and defeated the king of Jerusalem (Joshua 10:23–26 12:10), and later the city had been taken and destroyed by Judah (see Judges 1:7). But the Jebusites, who occupied Jerusalem, were not completely conquered, and either continued to hold at least a part of the city or retook it after being driven out (Joshua 15:63 Judges 1:21 19:11, 12). The dislodging of the Jebusites from this important stronghold was an important victory for David at the beginning of his reign over all Israel.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The inhabitants of Jebus had confidence in the strength of their city, and taunted David about his inability to take their fortress, telling him that the blind and the lame would be sufficient to hold the city against the forces of Israel. The Jebusite stronghold was on Mt. Zion, south of Mt. Moriah, the elevation on which the Temple was later built. The mountain was flanked on two sides by deep valleys, and was admirably suited for defense. To its defenders, Jebus seemed impregnable. It had held out against the Israelites for many years. Less than 4 mi. (6.4 km.) from Saul’s capital, Gibeah, the city still maintained its independence at the close of the reign of Saul. Nevertheless the capital of the Jebusites was not able to withstand the prowess of David and his able commander.</article>

    <shortdescription>In fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham, David's conquests extend the borders of Israel from Egypt to the Euphrates River. </shortdescription>
    <article>After David had been established on the throne he enjoyed a period of peace that was utilized for the organization and up-building of his kingdom. Realizing the strength of Israel, the surrounding nations refrained from attack, and David contented himself with affairs within his realm. At length, however, he decided to reduce his enemies to submission so that they would not be in a position to attack whenever the opportunity might present itself. The Philistines were defeated and made tributary, and part of their territory was annexed to Israel.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
David had previously enjoyed friendly relations with Moab, the Moabites having provided an asylum for his father and mother while he was a fugitive from Saul (1 Sam. 22:3, 4). The cause of David’s change of attitude toward Moab is not certainly known. There is a Jewish tradition to the effect that the Moabites had proved false to their trust and had slain David’s father and mother. For this there is no verification. It may also be true that in David’s war with the Philistines, Moab was guilty of some treachery, and thus became the object of his next determined attack.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
God gave great victory to David. He continued to stretch the borders of Israel bringing these nations into submission: Syria, Moab, the Philistines, Amalek, and Zobah.</article>

    <shortdescription>David brings the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem to establish this place as the new center of religious worship. It is brought on a cart like the Philistines transported it instead of having priests carry it. Uzzah touches the ark and dies.</shortdescription>
    <article>David purposed that Jerusalem should be not only the civil but also the religious capital of the nation. For many years the ark had been at Kirjath-jearim, where it had been taken upon its return from the Philistines after the death of Eli (1 Sam. 7:1). David desired to house the ark in a national shrine at Jerusalem. Before proceeding with this purpose he called together the leaders of the nation (1 Chron. 13:1–4), to counsel with them regarding his plan. The transfer of the ark was to be a matter of imposing display and national rejoicing. David requested 30,000 of the leading men of the realm to gather in Jerusalem to participate in the solemn festivities.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The law of Moses provided that the ark should be carried by the sons of Kohath (Num. 4:4–15 7:9). David should have heeded this instruction, but he probably reasoned that the conveying of the ark on a new cart drawn by oxen would be a mark of special respect. He no doubt remembered that when the Philistines returned the ark to Israel they brought it on a new cart (1 Sam. 6:7–14). That was an entirely different situation, however, for they had acted according to the best of their knowledge. When the ark arrived in Israel it was taken from the cart by Levites (1 Sam. 6:15) in harmony with the divine directions to Moses.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The ark had been placed in the house of Abinadab at least two or three generations earlier, after Eli’s death (1 Sam. 4:15–18 6:1 7:1). The fact that Uzzah and Ahio are called “sons of Abinadab” means only that they were his descendants, in harmony with Hebrew usage of this term. Since Uzzah and Ahio had exercised supervisory care of the ark while it was in their home, the responsibility of transferring it to Jerusalem was now placed in their charge. This, however, was definitely out of line with the Lord’s explicit directions that the ark was to be borne upon the shoulders of Kohathite Levites (Num. 4:15 7:9). There was no valid excuse for a disregard of the divine directions in this matter.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As the ark reached Nachon's threshing floor,  perhaps the oxen turned aside to snatch some of the scattered grain, thus causing the trouble. Uzzah put out his hand and touched the ark. The ark was holy. None but the priests, descendants of Aaron, were to touch it (Num. 4:15). God is strict regarding His requirements. True, the Philistines had touched the ark and no harm had resulted, but they could not be held accountable for what they did not know. The Israelites, however, knew the instruction that the Lord had given, but they disobeyed it. Man sees only the outward appearance, but God looks upon the heart. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
To those accompanying Uzzah it might have seemed as if Uzzah’s intentions were perfectly honorable—he was only trying to assist when he stretched forth his hand to steady the ark. But his heart was not right with God. His act of touching the ark was one of presumption. A sinful being should not have dared to touch that which symbolized the presence of God. The Lord could not permit to pass unnoticed this flagrant disregard of His express command. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
If Uzzah’s sins had been allowed to go unpunished, his guilt might have involved many others. Those who knew of Uzzah’s defections would have become greatly emboldened in sin if they had been allowed to conclude that faults like Uzzah’s could go uncorrected and the offender be accepted of God. Uzzah’s death served as a warning to many that the Lord is a righteous God, who requires strict obedience from all.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Some have regarded the death of Uzzah as a judgment of disproportionate severity. The incident took place, however, in a theocratic regime, when civil penalties covered religious infractions and the death penalty was inflicted for offenses for which it is no longer applied (Ex. 22:20 Lev. 20:2, 9, 27 Num. 15:32–36 cf. Acts 5:1–11). Severe penalties are necessary to deter evil. If our present stringent laws against crime were relaxed, there would be a tremendous upsurge of lawlessness.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Uzzah had been so long in the presence of the ark that familiarity had bred in him a spirit of irreverence. He had been guilty of rash and foolhardy presumption, and the Lord had dealt with him accordingly. The startling catastrophe caused the assembled hosts of Israel to realize the importance of God’s express commands and the awfulness of the sin of irreverence.</article>

    <shortdescription>After bringing the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem, David desires to build a permanent place for the sanctuary. He inquires of Nathan the prophet who says, "Do it." But God later tells Nathan that David's son will build the temple.</shortdescription>
    <article>David began to think of the inconsistency of having a beautiful home of his own but no place that could be called the house of God. The period of peace permitted David to give his time and energy to other things. Under these circumstances he began to contemplate the building of a temple for the worship of God. David called upon Nathan for guidance. This is the first mention of Nathan the prophet, but he was evidently already a confidential counselor of the king, to be consulted on important matters in which David desired specific directions from God. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The purpose of building a permanent temple expressed by David appeared good and Nathan naturally thought that it was right for the king to carry it into execution. The prophet, however, had not received any confirmatory message. He spoke according to his own sense of right, and not in response to divine revelation. But God later spoke to the prophet. The communication was distinctly marked as coming from God (see on v. 3), and was in direct opposition to Nathan’s earlier expressed view. There is no evidence, however, of any spirit of rebellion on the part of Nathan when he was asked to return to the king and acknowledge his previous error.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It was now about 450 years since the Exodus (see on 1 Kings 6:1). During that time the tabernacle had been the earthly dwelling place of God. It had frequently been moved from place to place, and even now the time had not yet arrived for a permanent place of worship for the children of Israel. These temporary arrangements having continued for so long a time, a tent could suffice for a little while longer until arrangements could be made for the building of the Temple. The word from Nathan indicated that David would not build the temple, but a son of David would accomplish the task.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
David was overwhelmed at the revelation that had been given to him. He was not to be permitted to build the Temple, but the promises made to him entirely compensated for the initial disappointment. As David sat in meditation he probably reviewed the years that had gone, thinking first of himself as a humble shepherd lad wandering over the hills and becoming acquainted with the ways of God then how he had been chosen for the kingdom, but had fled over the hills of Judah as a fugitive, little knowing one day what new trial and danger the next would bring forth. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Now at length he enjoyed peace, and with it came the promise from God as to the future of his kingdom. David was overwhelmed at the thought. With deep humility and utter self-abnegation he cried out, “Who am I, O Lord God?” By human standards David would be considered a man of extraordinary accomplishments, an unusual leader, a man of deep piety and great courage, a man of honor and success, one of the world’s greatest poets and one of history’s outstanding kings. But David felt deeply humble before his Maker, and as totally unworthy of the high honor God bestowed upon him and his house.</article>

    <shortdescription>David wants to show kindness to Jonathan's family and discovers his son, Mephibosheth, who is lame from being dropped as a child. David invites him to eat at his table like one of the king's sons.</shortdescription>
    <article>David’s kingdom was now secure, and there was little danger of any of the descendants of Saul seeking to obtain the throne. The king’s generous nature now manifested itself in his desire to show some kindness to the memory of Jonathan who died with his father Saul at the battle of Mt. Gilboa (ch. 1:4, 17). His son Mephibosheth was then only five years old (ch. 4:4). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Since Mephibosheth now had a young son, the experience here related must have taken place a number of years after David had come to the throne. But David had not forgotten his great friendship with Jonathan, and was now desirous of showing kindness to the house of his fallen enemy out of memory to his friend. So a search was made for Saul's descendents. It seems that Mephibosheth, fearful of his life, had secluded himself so successfully that his whereabouts were known to only a few of the closest friends of the house of Saul.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When called before King David, Mephibosheth realized that his life was at the mercy of the king. If David had so desired, he could have given orders for his execution in order that the seed of Saul might be completely wiped out of existence, and that there would be no possibility for a rival to arise from that source who might claim the throne. And so Mephibosheth spoke very humbly. Mephibosheth was the grandson of Saul, and his childhood memories were of the struggle between his uncle Ish-bosheth and David. He now stood before the king, pledging loyalty to the house of David. Henceforth he would be a servant of the king, faithfully doing his bidding.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
David expressed kindness to him and promised he would eat bread from his table all the days of his life. The expression need not be taken literally. The basic meaning is that the one to whom such a favor was shown was henceforth to be supported from the king’s bounty—in other words, he was to receive a life pension. Thus the 400 prophets of the grove did “eat at Jezebel’s table” (1 Kings 18:19). This simply means that these prophets, who were probably scattered throughout the realm, received their support from the queen. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Thus also Jehoiachin, after his release from prison, “did eat bread continually” before the king “all the days of his life” (2 Kings 25:29, 30). That is, a daily allowance was provided for him as long as he lived. In the case of Mephibosheth, however, special honor was involved, since he was placed on a par with David’s own sons (2 Sam. 9:11). He was to be treated like one of the children of David. Such treatment served further to endear David to Mephibosheth and to ensure mutual good will.</article>

    <shortdescription>When a three year famine strikes the land, David inquires of the Lord, why. God tells him it is because Saul unjustly killed the Gibeonites. David seeks to make things right and they request 7 of Saul's descendents to be hanged.</shortdescription>
    <article>When a famine strikes the land David concluded that there must be some reason for the famine. The Lord had told His people that if they were disobedient He would withhold His blessings (Deut. 28:15, 23, 24), and David now sought the Lord for the reason for this present famine. David discovers that Saul unjustly slew the Gibeonites. This is the only record of Saul’s offense against the Gibeonites. At the time of the conquest of Canaan the Gibeonites had succeeded through guile in making a league with Joshua. According to the terms of this league they were to be allowed to live with Israel in a state of servitude (Joshua 9:3–27).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
David should have addressed this question to God, even as he had addressed the previous inquiry concerning the cause of the famine. The record does not state that David took this matter to the Lord, nor does it affirm that what the Gibeonites demanded and what David carried out in response was in harmony with what God would have required in order to rectify the situation. Saul’s offense had been a gross misrepresentation of the religion of Jehovah. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
His attitude probably reflected that of the Israelites at large, who, even after Saul’s death, continued to show hostility to these foreigners in their midst whom they had pledged to protect. It was highly essential that the religion of God be vindicated. Precisely what God would have demanded by way of achieving this end is not revealed.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Unless the offense against the Gibeonites were removed, Israel could not hope to enjoy the blessing of the Lord. Hence if the wrong against the Gibeonites were atoned for, these people would prove to be the means of bringing back blessings to the nation of Israel. Saul must have wrought widespread havoc among the Gibeonites. As a people they were probably all but destroyed, with only a remnant remaining, probably scattered here and there throughout the land. Since Saul was primarily responsible for this crime, the Gibeonites now asked that his house should carry the blame.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "serpent." He is a king of the Ammonites in the time of Saul. After he dies his son Hanun is king. David seeks to show kindness to him, but the leaders say David's servants are spies, so they humiliate them, cutting off half their beards.</shortdescription>
    <article>David wished to show kindness to the son of Nahash, an Ammonite king. His father evidently helped David while a fugitive, so when Nahash died, David sent comforters to show respect and kindness to this king. David had sent his envoys to Ammon with friendly intentions, but his motive was misjudged. Nahash was never a true friend of David, but showed kindness to him simply because he also was an enemy of Saul. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Ammonites hated the Hebrews and despised the worship of the true God. Now they could not understand the true spirit of kindness that prompted David to send his envoys. His best intentions were misconstrued, and a false coloring was placed upon his motives. The words of the Ammonite princes were untrue and were destined to create trouble.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
To humiliate the comforters, they shaved off half of their beards. Such an insult could not be lightly accepted by Israel. It is a universal principle among nations that the person of an ambassador must be held inviolate. In heaping such rude indignities on David’s envoys, the Ammonites were openly asking for war. For some time they had been alarmed at David’s growing strength and had probably by now decided that the day of reckoning had come. But instead of starting hostilities themselves, they may have attempted, by this incident, to pursue a course that would make it appear that they were the ones who were attacked and aggrieved, so that they could claim the sympathy of their neighbors. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
They also cut off their garments. Appropriately, the envoys of David wore long robes. To cut off the bottom half of these outer robes, which subjected the wearer to shame and ridicule, was as much of an insult as cutting their beards. The outrage to the ambassadors was an insult to the nation they represented. David successful attacked and defeated both the Syrians and Ammonites.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>David commits adultery with one of his soldier's wives. Uriah is husband of Bathsheba. When she becomes pregnant, David tries to cover his sin and eventually has Uriah murdered. Later, Nathan the prophet confronts David who repents but the baby dies.</shortdescription>
    <article>David's men were out fighting and he stayed behind. One late afternoon or early evening David walked on the palace roof and noticed a woman bathing. When the temptation arose, David did not resist it, but descended from the roof with the determination to bring the evil thoughts of his heart into action. It was the tempter who had suggested the sin, and David should have turned him aside with a “Get thee behind me, Satan” (Mark 8:33). Instead, he listened to the seducer, and obeyed the voice of Satan instead of the voice of God. He discover the woman is Bathsheba. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Her father was one of David’s “mighty men” at arms, and Bath-sheba was the granddaughter of Ahithophel, the well-known counselor of David and Absalom (2 Sam. 15:12, 31). She is also married to Uriah the Hittite. The name of Uriah, like that of Eliam, appears in the list of David’s greatest heroes (ch. 23:39). Everything indicates that Uriah was a brave soldier and a man of upright character. The Hittites as a people were warlike and brave. David’s offense was particularly grievous since Bath-sheba was a married woman and her husband was one of David’s most noble and trusted officers, a man of an alien race who had been brought in contact with the religion of the true God.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
David sent for her. Bath-sheba was beautiful, and she was not beyond temptation. Possibly she was flattered by the overtures made to her by the king, and yielded herself to David without resistance, though Nathan's parable of a lamb "taken away" from the owner might indicate otherwise. Later she sent a note to David. The information was necessary both for her own and David’s safety and for the king’s honor. Both parties in the case of adultery were to be punished by death (Lev. 20:10) hence to escape the penalty, the guilty would naturally seek to conceal the sin. Bath-sheba turned to David for help. If Uriah discovered that his wife was with child by David, he might avenge himself by taking the lives of both David and Bath-sheba, or by inciting the nation to revolt because of such a disgraceful deed on the part of the king.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
David’s sin brought him into desperate straits. Concealment by deceit seemed to offer a hope of escape. Instead of humbly confessing his sin and relying upon divine mercy and guidance, David took matters into his own hand, only to find that he was adding sin to sin, and was constantly bringing himself into greater difficulties. As an important and trusted officer, Uriah would be well acquainted with the course of the war. David now sent for him as if to inquire for details concerning the course of the siege, and particularly concerning the conduct of Joab, as if he were desirous of some confidential report regarding the commander in chief. The degrading falsehood and dissimulation to which David stooped in the hope of concealing his sin reveals the results of a course of evil.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
David tried to convince Uriah to go home and sleep with his wife. The plan did not work and David later sends a message through Uriah to Joab to urge Uriah to enter the heat of the battle and then pull back so that he would die, which is what happened. David then marries Bathsheba. Nathan the prophet later confronts David who repents. But the child dies anyway.</article>

    <shortdescription>After David takes Bathsheba as his wife, Nathan the prophet comes to rebuke him through a parable. David confesses his sin. Nathan says he will not die, but his son dies even after David fasts and prays.</shortdescription>
    <article>As time went on David’s sin came out into the open. It became known that David himself was the father of the child that was born to Bath-sheba, and suspicions arose that it was he who had brought about the death of Uriah. David was not only the civil ruler of his people but also “the Lord’s anointed,” the head of the theocracy, the leader of God’s chosen people, and the one who was to uphold and enforce the law of the Lord. David by his sin had brought reproach and dishonor upon the name of the Lord. God therefore sent Nathan to David to deliver the message of divine rebuke, in an attempt to bring the erring king to a realization of the magnitude of his crime and to repentance.&lt;BR /&gt;
 &lt;BR /&gt;
David was without excuse. He knew that he was in the wrong and that the sentence pronounced on himself was just. In spite of the magnitude of his crime, his conscience was not yet dead. He had succeeded for a time in hiding his crime from the eyes of men, but he did not succeed in hiding it from God. Through a chain of circumstances the Lord allowed him to catch a glimpse of the terrible nature of the crime he had committed and to pronounce a just sentence against himself. The unflinching application of the parable to the king portrays the holy boldness and faithfulness of God’s prophet. This plain-spoken rebuke might well have cost Nathan his life, but he did not waver in performing his duty.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The boldness and suddenness of Nathan’s words brought a shock to David that woke him from the evil spell that his crimes had cast upon him. David had been essentially a good man, one who endeavored to obey the Lord. But he had yielded to temptation, and in the attempt to cover up his guilt had become ever more deeply entangled in a net of evil. For a time his senses had seemed to be stupefied by a delirium of power, prosperity, and perfidy. Now he was suddenly brought back to his senses. David had given the judgment that “the man that hath done this thing shall surely die” (v. 5). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
By his own sentence David was the one who should die. But instead, God decreed that the child of his sin should die (see PP 722). To David the death of the child would be a far greater punishment than his own death. As a result of the bitter experience he would pass through, David would be brought to a full measure of repentance and conversion.</article>

    <shortdescription>After Nathan the prophet confronts David over his sin with Bathsheba, the prophet predicts the child will die. David fasts and prays but the child still dies.</shortdescription>
    <article>Even after He has pronounced judgment God has sometimes seen fit to turn aside the penalty in response to sincere repentance and earnest petitions to Him (Ex. 32:9–14 cf. Jonah 3:4–10). David knew that God was “merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth” (Ex. 34:6). He therefore pleaded earnestly for forgiveness and for the life of the child. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
However, this does not imply that he refused submission to the divine will. He simply hoped that God’s mercy might spare the child. But the child died. The death of the child was God’s solemn answer to the earnest entreaty of the father. God did not give a favorable answer to David’s petitions, but the king was humbly submissive to the divine will. When Heaven’s answer is contrary to our plea we must remember that God knows best, and that for some reason, often unknown to us, He sees that it is not best to extend the life of the one who is sick.</article>

    <shortdescription>David writes Psalm 32 after his grievous sin with Bathsheba. It is a psalm of deep confession, repentance, and restoration.</shortdescription>
    <article>Psalm 32 is a penitential psalm. It unites personal penitence with instruction to others. The psalm has the profound purpose of showing the blessedness of the forgiveness of sin. It was composed after David committed his grievous sin with Bath-sheba and is a record of his confession and the forgiveness he obtained (see 2 Sam. 11 12). Verses 1–5 deal with David’s personal experience vs. 6–11 give counsel. The psalm is reported to have been a favorite of Augustine’s to the moment of death. The theologian had the psalm written on the wall, that he might see it from his sickbed.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "peaceful." He is David's second son by Bathsheba and succeeds David as king as a young man and reigns 40 years like David. His is a golden age of monarchy with great splendor. Solomon is known for amazing wisdom but also moral failures.</shortdescription>
    <article>Solomon. The son of David and Bathsheba (2 Sa 12:24 1 Chr 3:5), and the third and last king of united Israel, who reigned from c. 971 to c. 931 b.c. In one passage he is called Jedidiah, “beloved of Yahweh” (2 Sa 12:25). This was possibly his personal name and Solomon his throne name or the reverse may have been true.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
I. Accession.Solomon was made king shortly before his father’s death, and owed his crown to the watchfulness of the prophet Nathan. Hearing that Solomon’s older brother Adonijah, supported by Joab, was to be proclaimed king, the prophet appealed to David through Bathsheba for quick action. In response Solomon, supported by Zadok the priest, Benaiah, a high military officer, and David’s bodyguard, was immediately proclaimed king. This prompt action brought a quick end to Adonijah’s conspiracy (1 Ki 1:5–40). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
After David’s death Solomon executed his most violent opponents. About the same time he married an Egyptian princess (ch 3:1), probably a daughter of one of the last kings of the 21st dynasty. During a visit to Gibeon, where the tabernacle of the Lord was at that time, he had a dream in which God asked him to make his desires known, and promised that they would be granted. In response Solomon requested wisdom, which so pleased God that wealth and honor were promised him in addition to the requested wisdom (1 Ki 3:4–15 2 Chr 1:3–13).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
II. Reign. Solomon’s relations with other countries during his 40-year reign were generally good. Through his marriage with the Egyptian princess he came into possession of the city of Gezer, which had remained in Canaanite hands up to that time (1 Ki 9:16). He waged only one war, that against Hamath-zobah, to make his northern possessions more secure (2 Chr 8:3). With Phoenicia he concluded a trade agreement (1 Ki 5:1–12). Apparently he also had good relations with other neighboring nations, such as Ammon, Moab, Edom, and the Hittite city-states of northern Syria, countries from which he imported women for his harem (chs 11:1 14:21). He had contact even with distant Sheba in South Arabia (ch 10:1–13). Solomon divided Israel into 12 administrative provinces, which did not in every case correspond with tribal boundaries. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
They were administered by an able corps of officers, some of whom were bound to the king by marriage ties (1 Ki 4:1–19). For his extensive building enterprises Solomon initiated a system of forced labor, which became very unpopular in the course of time (chs 5:13–16 9:15, 20, 23). Besides his workmen, he also drafted an immense number of Israelites for his infantry, chariotry, and horsemen (1 Ki 9:22).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
III. Building Activity in Jerusalem. For many years Solomon’s main attention was directed toward the beautification of his capital. His father, David, who was not permitted to build a temple, had amassed much building material for such a structure (1 Chr 29:2–8 cf. ch 17:4), and had bought a site north of “David’s City,” the old Mount Moriah. Solomon’s building activities in Jerusalem lasted 20 years, 7 years of which were spent in building the magnificent Temple which brought him great fame (1 Ki 6:37, 38), and 13 years in erecting the palace buildings (ch 7:1). Solomon’s architect and some of his builders were from Tyre. The Phoenicians also supplied him with material for the buildings and furnishings (chs 5:1–18 7:13, 14). New walls were erected for the widely extended city area (ch 9:15).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
IV. Failure. Solomon was an Oriental monarch who loved luxury, and who unfortunately followed in many of the ways of Oriental despots. Outstanding among his mistakes was his taking many foreign wives. These brought about disloyalty toward God, which in turn resulted in the breakup of his empire after his death. To accommodate these women he erected pagan sanctuaries and shrines and he himself occasionally worshiped at them (1 Ki 11:1–13). Another mistake Solomon made was to tax the people heavily over an extended period. His forced-labor program was especially unpopular and became the most visible cause of the breakup of the kingdom immediately following his death (ch 12:4–16).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
V. Religious Life and Literary Activity. Solomon began his reign as a deeply spiritual leader of his nation, one who desired nothing so much as wisdom adequately to serve God and the interests of his people (1 Ki 3:3–9). His prayer and his counsel to the people at the dedication of the Temple show that he stood close to God (ch 8:22–61). However, his wealth and luxury, but especially his many wives, corrupted him so that he finally became an idolater (ch 11:3–8). In later life he regretted the follies of his way, as statements he made in Ecclesiastes reveal (chs 1:1, 12–17 2:1–11).</article>

    <shortdescription>Amnon falls in love with his half-sister, Tamar. His friend Jonadab advises him how to lure Tamar into his house. He rapes her then despises her. David is morally weak &amp; does nothing. Absalom, Tamar's brother, is furious and later murders Amnon. </shortdescription>
    <article>The series of narratives that follow (chs. 13 to 21) is an account of misfortunes that overtook David after his sin. Chronicles makes no mention of these calamities, as that record also fails to mention David’s sin. After his adultery with Bath-sheba and his murder of Uriah, David was a changed man. He had lost much of his former confidence in himself nor was he longer complete master of his realm. The people no longer had implicit confidence, and thus were slow to listen to his admonitions concerning the rewards of righteousness or the evils of transgression. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When he saw others do the things for which he had set the example, it was difficult to reprove them. His own sons refused to obey him and no longer respected his counsel. Where before he had been strong and courageous, he now became weak and hesitant. A sense of shame constantly hung over him. The following chapters portray the course of events that in part, at least, were consequent upon David’s transgression.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Amnon falls in love with his sister Tamar. He wanted her and actually fretted himself sick because of his inability to gratify his wishes in regard to Tamar. His friendship with Jobadab led him down an evil pathway. He suggests Amnon pretends to be ill and asks his sister to bring him food, after which he rapes her. Without anyone else in the house, Tamar had no one to aid her in her attempts to resist her brother’s evil and determined purpose. She first tried to reason with him, speaking of the sinfulness of such an act and of its folly. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Tamar tried to bring Amnon to his senses by pointing out that in doing such a deed he would disgrace her, the king’s daughter and his sister, for life. If he had any regard for her, certainly he would not wish to bring such a humiliation upon her and upon the king’s household. After his cruel deed Amnon hated Tamar. The result was typical. Amnon was moved, not by love, but by passion, and now that his animal lusts were gratified, he had no further regard for his sister, whom he had so cruelly wronged.</article>

    <shortdescription>After Amnon rapes his half-sister and David does nothing about it, Absalom 2 years later invites his father and brothers to sheer sheep. David doesn't go but Absalom asks if Amnon may go. David consents. While Amnon is drunk Absalom murders him.</shortdescription>
    <article>Absalom seeks revenge on Amnon who raped his sister. He invites his father and brother's to sheer sheep. This invitation of course included Amnon, for the real purpose of Absalom in giving the feast was to secure the opportunity of seizing him. Absalom’s deep guile is revealed in this invitation to David. He hardly expected his father to come, but by urging him to do so, he would help to allay suspicion and would thus encourage the attendance of Amnon. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
David declined the invitation on the ground that the attendance of so many might be burdensome to Absalom. By continuing to urge his father’s attendance, Absalom effectively disguised his real purpose and succeeded in securing David’s blessing on the festivities. Everything now appeared above suspicion.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
David’s sons were now grown, but evidently the father still continued to exercise some measure of control over their activities. Amnon was particularly invited, since he was the eldest son and the heir apparent, who could represent his father at the feast. By continued urging Absalom finally broke down his father’s resistance and secured his consent that not only Amnon but all the princes (v. 29) be permitted to attend the feast. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
While feasting and drinking, Absalom smites Amnon. At this time David’s second son, Chileab (ch. 3:3), was possibly already dead, for we hear nothing of him in the record. If so, the death of Amnon would thus make Absalom the next in line for the throne (see ch. 3:2, 3). Perhaps Absalom’s servants thought that his orders for the death of Amnon were aimed at securing his own succession to the throne.</article>

    <shortdescription>After Absalom murders his half-brother Amnon, he flees to Geshur. Joab uses a trick to convince David to let Absalom come back from exile. Absalom returns but does not see the king for 2 years.</shortdescription>
    <article>Joab had attained his purpose through deceit to convince David to reconcile with Absalom. The king wisely commissioned him to carry the tidings to Absalom and to bring him home. Joab had good reason for thanking the king. If David had granted an unfavorable decision, Joab would have been held accountable for the situation. But Absalom was not allowed into David's presence. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Absalom’s murder of Amnon was not yet forgotten, and for the sake of the nation and Absalom himself, David felt it necessary to show his abhorrence of the crime that had been committed. Being at home but not being allowed to see the face of his father or to appear with his brethren at the court began to prey upon the mind of Absalom. He felt that he was being wronged, and the people came to sympathize with him. In the eyes of the nation he was a hero who was to be praised for an act of right and justice rather than a criminal to be shunned for a misdeed.</article>

    <shortdescription>Absalom returns from exile in Geshur but does not see the face of King David for 2 years. He tries to gain a hearing but Joab turns away until Absalom has Joab's barley field set on fire. Absalom finally sees his father who kisses and forgives him.</shortdescription>
    <article>After murdering his brother, Absalom was banished from Jerusalem, but was eventually brought back by Joab. But he was not permitted to see the king. This naturally made Absalom bitter and morose, causing him to think that he was being unjustly treated. In his own eyes he probably felt that he had done no wrong in putting Amnon to death, since he had only meted out justice. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Absalom was selfish and unscrupulous, ambitious and impulsive. He was admired by the people and was gradually winning their sympathies. It was hardly the part of wisdom for David to allow such a situation to continue. Since Joab had been successful in his former efforts, Absalom thought that he again might be of service. But Joab doubtless felt that he had already done as much as was wise, and that he would incur the king’s displeasure if he took any further steps in the matter.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
So Abasalom sets Joab's barley field on fire to force the issue. Absalom treated Joab as his servant, giving to him his orders and expecting them to be carried out. His conduct reveals how far he had already gone in his course of rebellion and his determination to secure a redress of his supposed grievances and a restoration to privileges he believed to be rightfully his. No attempt was made to explain his arson. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
He acted as if he were fully within his rights in taking the measures he did to bring Joab to him, and as if Joab were under obligation to carry out his wishes. Absalom had been allowed to come home, but the king still refused to see him. Such treatment was to Absalom more galling than his exile. In the popular estimation David was unduly harsh in his treatment of his son, and the people were gradually drawn toward Absalom.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Absalom was finally admitted into the royal presence. He was given such treatment as indicated an outward reconciliation at least. Compare Esau kissing Jacob, and Joseph, his brethren (Gen. 33:4 45:15). David’s memory of his own guilt made him listless and irresolute. He apparently knew not which way to turn or what course to pursue. He recognized his duty, but the memory of his own transgression prevented him from doing what he knew should be done.</article>

    <shortdescription>Absalom commits treason and gathers people in Hebron to proclaim him king. David hears of this and flees Jerusalem in shame and sorrow with all his servants. Like Christ, David also ascends the Mount of Olives weeping as Absalom comes into the city.</shortdescription>
    <article>Absalom was secretly scheming to secure the crown. In order to impress the people he assumed an attitude that he thought befitted the heir apparent. He had 50 men run before him. A bodyguard for the prince. By these measures Absalom appeared to be setting forth his claim to succeed to the throne. This was equivalent to issuing a general pronouncement that he considered himself the one who would next be king. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
He also met people at the city gate the place where public business was carried on and where the judges took their position for the administration of justice (see on Gen. 19:1). The people were wont to come to the king for judgment, but justice was slow. David’s preoccupation with his troubles, his hesitation to take a firm stand in rebuking wrong, evidently showed in his administration of public affairs. Absalom, however, courted public favor, placing himself in the way of the people and putting his time and services at their command.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Absalom succeeded in creating a general discontent with David’s administration of government. The fickle populace did not see through his scheme. The means employed were dishonest and unfair. Absalom purposely deceived the people, creating suspicion, disaffection, and animosity against the king. Everywhere men praised Absalom and criticized the king. People were wishing that David would abdicate so that Absalom might take his seat upon the throne.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Hebron was the place  chosen as the site for Absalom’s rebellion. It was his birthplace (ch. 3:2, 3), and the site of David’s first capital. Many of the inhabitants were probably not reconciled to the transfer of the capital to Jerusalem. Being the place of Absalom’s birth, it afforded a plausible pretext for holding there the great sacrificial feast in fulfillment of Absalom’s supposed vow. Absalom pretended to make his return to Jerusalem appear to be a providence of God, granted him in return for a solemn vow made while he was still an exile at Geshur.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When the rebellion was made known, David suggested that those in his favor flee Jerusalem. The decision was wise, for David at the moment was totally unprepared for the crisis. In his great peril David shook off his lethargy and indecision and seemed to regain something of his early courage and swiftness of action. The sequel proved this to have been the correct course of action. Both Ahithophel (ch. 17:1, 2) and Hushai (ch. 17:7–13) recognized that delay would be fatal, and that Absalom’s greatest hope for success would be to take immediate steps against David. By his flight David gave himself time to make ready a defense, and the people time to ponder their course. The horrors of a long civil war were thus averted. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
David feared that he could not at the moment make a successful stand at Jerusalem. Disaffection within the city, or perhaps even in his own household, might turn the tide against him. There would not be the spirit of unity that could have been expected if Jerusalem had been attacked by a foreign foe. It was his own son who would make the assault, and he undoubtedly had many supporters within the city.</article>

    <shortdescription>David takes a census of Israel and Judah. God had not specifically asked him to do this. An enemy (Satan) incites him according to 1 Chr. 21, but 2 Sam. 24 says the Lord "moved David." Exodus 30 has guidelines on this. Pride usually is the motive.</shortdescription>
    <article>Satan instigated the pride and ambition that led Israel’s king to promote procedures to increase the size of his army for the purpose of extending the boundaries of Israel by new military conquests. David decided to take a count of the number of Israel. There is nothing in the narrative to indicate precisely when in the life of David this incident took place. The fact that Joab was engaged in the work for almost ten months (v. 8) shows that it must have been at a time of freedom from war. In the parallel account (1 Chron. 24:21) the narrative is immediately followed by the record of David’s preparations for the building of the Temple. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In both Samuel and Chronicles these preparations are among the last items to be recorded for David’s reign. All this leads to the conclusion that the military census took place toward the end of David’s reign. Joab was a hardened and unscrupulous general, but even he could see that the taking of such a census was out of keeping with the fundamental principles of the Hebrew monarchy. By a number of questions he endeavored to cause David to recognize the folly of his course. As the census was under way, David began to think over the implications of what he had done and to realize that he was making a mistake. It was the Spirit of God that spoke to him and showed him the folly of his course. In deep humility he confessed his mistake before God and asked for forgiveness.</article>

    <shortdescription>Also "Sheshonk." He is the founder of the 22nd dynasty of Egypt who attempts to regain Egypt's lost power but waits until after Solomon's death when Israel and Judah divide. He invades Judah and conquers Jerusalem, carrying away its treasures.</shortdescription>
    <article>Shishak, better known by its Grecized form Sheshonk. The founder of the 22d dynasty (Libyan) of Egypt, who attempted to re-establish the Asiatic empire that had been lost since the time of the Ramessides. He began to reign c. 945 b.c. but dared no conquests during Solomon’s reign, although he harbored Solomon’s enemies or rebels as guests (1 Ki 11:40, cf. vs 17–22). But when upon the death of Solomon the Hebrew kingdom split into 2 factions, he took advantage of the unsettled state of affairs in Palestine, and invaded the country in the 5th year of King Rehoboam of Judah (c. 926/25 b.c.). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Biblical records mention only the invasion of Judah and the conquest of Jerusalem, from which city Shishak carried away the treasures of Solomon (1 Ki 14:25, 26 2 Chr 12:2–9), but Shishak’s victory relief carved on the temple wall at Karnak mentions more than 100 cities captured from Judah and Israel, among them Megiddo. His conquest of Megiddo in the northern kingdom has been confirmed by the discovery in excavations of the city of a fragment of a victory stele. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
However, his campaign was not much more than a raid, and the internal restless conditions in Egypt did not allow him to follow up his foreign conquests. In the tomb of one of Shishak’s grandsons, discovered by P. Montet at Tanis, a golden bracelet was discovered, inscribed with the name of Shishak. It is intriguing to consider that it is quite possible, though there is no evidence, that this bracelet was made of gold that had been taken from the treasures of Solomon. Shishak’s tomb has not yet been found.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "may the people increase." He is the son of Nebat and the first king over Israel. He is a servant of Solomon who rebels against the king and escapes to Egypt until Solomon dies. He returns to be king of the 10 northern tribes.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jeroboam. The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel, usually referred to as Jeroboam I (c. 931–c. 910 b.c.). He was an Ephraimite from Zeredah, the son of Nebat and of Zeruah (1 Ki 11:26). While foreman over a company of builders during the construction of the *Millo at Jerusalem, Jeroboam was told by the prophet Ahijah of Shiloh that he would become king over 10 of Israel’s tribes (vs 27–39). Jeroboam was not a man to wait patiently for God to work out His plans and to give him the promised kingdom, as David had done under similar circumstances. Instead he seems to have begun at once to plot against Solomon (v 27). When this was discovered, Solomon attempted to kill him, but Jeroboam fled to Egypt (v 40). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
There he found refuge with Pharaoh Shishak, the founder of the twenty second dynasty, who seems to have discontinued his predecessor’s friendly policy toward Solomon. When news of Solomon’s death and news that the new king of Israel was to be crowned at Shechem reached Jeroboam in Egypt, he returned to Palestine (ch 12:1–3). At once he became spokesman for the people and demanded a promise from Rehoboam, Solomon’s son, that the public burden be alleviated (vs 3–5). Rehoboam, misled by the foolish advice of inexperienced counselors, refused to meet the justified grievances of the people. As a result the 10 northern tribes declared their independence from the house of David and proclaimed Jeroboam their king (vs 6–20).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jeroboam immediately took drastic measures to prevent the two kingdoms from reuniting. He founded two new temples, one at Dan on the northern border of the country and the other at Bethel on the southern border not far from the main highway to Jerusalem. In both places bull images were set up as visible cult symbols for the worship of Yahweh (1 Ki 12:26–30). In his proclamation calling upon the people to worship at these places, Jeroboam echoed the words that Aaron had pronounced at Mount Sinai to gather the people for the worship of the golden calf (cf. 1 Ki 12:28 with Ex 32:4). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This bull worship, which was probably an imitation of the Canaanite worship of El under the image of a bull, became the “sin of Jeroboam,” which was followed by practically every ruler of the northern kingdom (1 Ki 15:26, 34 16:19, 31 22:52 etc.). Jeroboam also appointed as priests men who were not of the tribe of Levi, and ordered that the chief feasts should be celebrated during the 8th month, not in the 7th, as was done in Judah (ch 12:31, 32).</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "he enlarges the people." He is the son of Solomon through Naamah, an Ammonite princess. He is 41 when he becomes king and rejects demands for relief from the northern tribes who rebel and split the kingdom. He reigns 18 years.</shortdescription>
    <article>Rehoboam. The son of Solomon by his Ammonite wife Naamah. He began to reign at the age of 41 as the 1st king of the southern kingdom of Judah, after the division (1 Ki 11:43 14:21), and reigned 17 years (c. 931–c. 913 b.c.). At his accession representatives of the nation assembled at Shechem, the most centrally located city of the country, to crown the new king. However, led by Jeroboam, they first demanded that the public burdens be alleviated. Rehoboam, promising to give his answer after 3 days, in the meantime sought counsel of both old and young advisers of the realm. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Finally he rejected the counsel of the old men, who urged him to grant the people’s justified requests, and accepted the advice of younger men, brought up with him, who advised him to refuse the people’s demands. He defied the petitioners by declaring that he would lash them with scorpions instead of with whips as his father had done. The result was that all the northern and eastern tribes of Israel broke with the house of David and made Jeroboam their king. Rehoboam tried to bring the rebellious tribes back by sending Adoniram, the officer over forced labor, to arbitrate. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This man, however, apparently because of violent hatred, was immediately killed. Rehoboam, now recognizing the seriousness of the situation, returned to Jerusalem and began at once to make military preparations for war against Jeroboam, to bring the rebellious tribes back by force, and desisted only when the prophet Shemaiah in the name of God forbade the proposed assault (1 Ki 11:43 to 12:24 2 Chr 9:31 to 11:4). Nevertheless, there were acts of warfare between the two nations during the later years of Rehoboam’s reign (1 Ki 14:30).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Rehoboam’s character showed that he had inherited both good and bad traits from his father. He obeyed the prophet Shemaiah by refraining from fighting against Jeroboam (1 Ki 12:24 2 Chr 11:4) he humbled himself before God at the time of Shishak’s invasion (2 Chr 12:6, 12) he received into his kingdom the priests and Levites who were driven out from the northern kingdom by the introduction of Jeroboam’s calf worship at Bethel and Dan (ch 11:11–17). Yet after he had served God for 3 years (v 17), he “did evil” (ch 12:14) by allowing the building of pagan high places, tolerating the practice of immoral rites, and worshipping foreign gods (1 Ki 14:22–24). Rehoboam had 18 wives, 60 concubines, 28 sons, and 60 daughters (2 Chr 11:21).</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "my Lord is Yahweh." He seeks to overtake the kingdom from his half-brother Solomon. He makes a request to Bathsheba who in turns speaks to Solomon. The king recognizes Adonijah's motives and has him struck dead.</shortdescription>
    <article>Adonijah, whose name means “Yahweh is my Lord”, is the son who, when David was old, aspired to the crown (1 Kings 1:5), and was later put to death by Solomon (1 Kings 2:24, 25). After the death of his three elder brothers, Chileab being presumably dead, Adonijah regarded himself the rightful heir to the throne. He approaches Bathsheba. The very appearance of Adonijah upon the scene raised a question concerning his intentions. Had he reconciled himself to his fate and was he ready to support Solomon, or was he still hoping by some means to secure the kingdom? Adonijah’s reference to his unsuccessful attempt to secure the throne gives evidence that the matter was still very much alive within his heart. Bath-sheba’s apprehensions seem to have been well founded. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
But, she goes before the king on his behalf. Solomon is giving vent to his disgust at his mother’s shortsightedness for having allowed herself to be drawn into such a situation as this. Things were already bad enough without her lending her aid to the efforts of Adonijah to secure the throne. Adonijah was, after all, the elder brother, and many would think he had a just claim to the throne. And at his side were two of the most influential men of the land, Abiathar, the high priest, and Joab, the commander in chief, aiding and abetting him in every possible way. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Now the king’s mother had allowed herself to be taken in to the extent that she was actually asking for nothing less than the kingdom for the elder son. Solomon said in effect, “Why ask only for Abishag, why not ask for the kingdom as well? He is my elder brother, and does it not by right belong to him? And in proof of his claims, does he not have with him Abiathar the priest and Joab as well, in support of his cause and giving evidence to all that he indeed is in the right?” Bath-sheba evidently understood the needed rebuke. Knowing that what he was doing was in accord with the will of Heaven, Solomon, with a solemn adjuration, gave judgment that Adonijah be put to death that day.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Hiram, the Phoenician king of Tyre, offers to assist Solomon in building the temple. He was a friend of David. The king offers cedars from Lebanon and workers to help. The two kings have a treaty of peace. Solomon gives food to Hiram.</shortdescription>
    <article>In 2 Sam. 5:11 and 1 Chron. 14:1 Hiram is mentioned as having sent workmen and materials to David for the building of his house. According to Josephus the Temple was built in the 11th (Antiquities viii. 3. 1) or the 12th (Against Apion 1. 18) year of Hiram. Since the founding of the Temple took place in the fourth year of Solomon (1 Kings 6:1), the reign of Hiram must have overlapped that of David by some seven or eight years. After having given a general description of Solomon’s government, 1 Kings 5 proceeds with an account of the great undertaking of his reign, the building of the Temple. A parallel account of this important enterprise is found in 2 Chron. 2 to 4. It explain why David did not build the temple. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It was not that David was so occupied with wars during his reign that he did not find time or opportunity to build the Temple, but that the Lord did not permit him to do this because of his having been so much a man of war (1 Chron. 22:8). It was not the Lord’s purpose that Israel should be in constant war against her neighbors. During the reign of David war was necessary for the establishment of the throne. But God had promised David a son who would be a “man of rest,” and that He would “give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days” (1 Chron. 22:9). The name Solomon means “peaceable.” Solomon recognized the fact that the rest he enjoyed had come to him as a blessing from God.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
There is given in 1 Kings 5 an abbreviated form a portion of Solomon’s message to Hiram, which is given much more fully in 2 Chron. 2:3–10. The request was not only for cedar trees but also for almug (2 Chron. 2:8) and fir trees (1 Kings 5:8, 10), and also for “a man cunning to work in gold,” silver, brass, and iron (2 Chron. 2:7). In return for the timber, Solomon undertook to provide Hiram with provisions of wheat, barley, wine, and oil (2 Chron. 2:10 cf. 1 Kings 5:11). The specific purpose of the building of the Temple is presented in much fuller detail in 2 Chron. 2:4–6. There appears to have been a formal, written agreement between Solomon and Hiram (2 Chron. 2:11). Solomon set forth the terms of the contract, and they were promptly accepted by Hiram. Hiram agreed to deliver the timber desired by Solomon in harmony with the stipulations agreed upon. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The arrangement entered into between Solomon and Hiram was mutually advantageous. Solomon needed timber of which he had little and Hiram had much. Hiram needed foodstuffs of which Phoenicia produced little and of which Israel may have had an oversupply. Both gave of what they had and received what they needed, and both were benefited as a result. Both were happy in this arrangement that promoted prosperity as well as peace.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "Yahweh has heard." He is the son of Gera, of the house of Saul. He viewed David as a usurper to the throne &amp; cursed him as he fled Jerusalem. David later forgave him. After disobeying Solomon he is executed &amp; the kingdom is established.</shortdescription>
    <article>The situation within the realm was such that Solomon deemed it necessary to keep a close watch on all suspected persons. Restless Shimei was among those who might be expected to throw in their lot against the king whenever the opportunity might come. He was known to be an adherent of the house of Saul and a bitter foe of the house of David. To restrict Shimei to the confines of Jerusalem was only a reasonable precaution against treason. The story in 1 Kings 2 gives no hint that Shimei’s journey to Gath for the sake of bringing back his servants was not made in good faith. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
But the fact remains that he had been disobedient to the king’s command and had broken his own solemn vow. It is upon this that stress is laid. If Shimei had wished to remain true to his oath, he should have informed the king of the circumstances, made request for permission to go and bring his servants back, and awaited the king’s command. But by taking matters into his own hands, and by venturing into a foreign land that had often been at war with Solomon’s father, Shimei was certainly laying himself open to suspicion.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Solomon did not pass judgment upon Shimei without due consideration of the case and without setting all the facts clearly before the accused. With searching questions Solomon made it clear that Shimei was without defense. Shimei had given his solemn oath that he would abide by the king’s decree. Why had he not kept that oath? The answer of silence became the sentence of death. No man knows so well all the hidden wickedness of the heart as the transgressor himself. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
With his life at stake, Shimei knew that his own wicked heart was the most telling witness against himself. God is not an arbitrary executioner of the sentence against transgression. Sinners reap in judgment what they themselves have sown. It was Shimei’s own iniquity, not merely the judgment of an earthly king, that condemned him to death. The Bible says after his death that "the kingdom was established."</article>

    <shortdescription>Solomon makes a treaty with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and marries his daughter. Such marriages served political and economic purposes. This Pharaoh may have been Siamun who gave his daughter Gezer as dowry.</shortdescription>
    <article>Solomon’s first objective after taking the throne was to establish internal security. That end achieved, he was in a position to give his attention to outside interests. The first item mentioned is the royal marriage to a daughter of Pharaoh. In the case of the reign of David over Judah, there is also first the mention of measures taken to ensure internal security (2 Sam. 2:1–32 3:1), followed by a mention of David’s sons and wives (2 Sam. 3:2–5), and after his anointing as king of Israel (2 Sam. 5:1–3), the first item reported is the establishment of his power over Israel (2 Sam. 5:6–12), followed once more by a mention of his wives and concubines (2 Sam. 5:13–16).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Pharaoh with whom Solomon is mentioned as having made affinity is believed to be one of the kings of the Twenty-first Dynasty, whose capital was at Tanis in Lower Egypt. It must have been a predecessor of Shishak (Sheshonk), founder of the Twenty-second Dynasty, who invaded Judah in the fifth year of Rehoboam (1 Kings 14:25).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Political alliances were frequently sealed by marriages between the royal families. No rebuke is given by the sacred historian for Solomon’s marriage with this idolatrous princess. He simply records the incident. But his absence of censure places no sanction upon the act. The marriage was in direct violation of the command of God. Though Pharaoh’s daughter forsook the religion of her native Egypt and threw in her lot with the Hebrews, among whom she had come to live (PK 53), this salutary result did not justify the foreign marriage. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Pharaoh took the city of Gezer from the Canaanites and presented it to his daughter as a dowry and to the nation of Israel (1 Kings 9:16). The residence of Pharaoh’s daughter in the City of David was only temporary, until Solomon had constructed his own palace. This palace was to be north of David’s city, in the Temple area. A separate house was later to be built for his Egyptian wife (1 Kings 7:8).</article>

    <shortdescription>Solomon marries the daughter of Pharaoh. This Egyptian king conqueres Gezer and gives it to his daughter as a dowry.</shortdescription>
    <article>Gezer  was an important Canaanite town, on a bastion extending out into the maritime plain, 6 1/4 mi. (10 km.) west-northwest of Aijalon, on the boundary of Ephraim (Joshua 16:3). The city was assigned to the Levites (Joshua 21:21), but was not taken at the time of the conquest (Judges 1:29), although it was tributary for a time (Joshua 16:10). It occupied a strategic position in the plain of Aijalon, an important pass, frequently used by the Philistines making their way to the central highlands. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It is mentioned on a number of occasions in connection with the battles of David (2 Sam. 5:25 1 Chron. 14:16 20:4). Gezer was taken by Pharaoh and given as a dowry on the occasion of the marriage of his daughter to Solomon. There are a number of records of grants of important territorial rights as dowries on the occasion of royal weddings in the ancient East.</article>

    <shortdescription>Early in King Solomon's reign he goes to Gibeon to offer sacrifices to the Lord. In a dream God says, "Ask! What shall I give you?" He asks for wisdom and a discerning heart. This pleases God who also promises riches and long life if he is obedient.</shortdescription>
    <article>Solomon traveled to Gibeon, a town that was nearly 6 mi. (9.6 km.) northwest of Jerusalem. After the success of the measures taken to establish the kingdom Solomon held a great festival at Gibeon for the whole nation (2 Chron. 1:1–3), in grateful thanksgiving to the Lord for the blessings conferred. The tabernacle that had been built in the wilderness was located there (2 Chron. 1:3). It will be recalled that, long before, the Gibeonites had deceived Joshua, and accordingly had been sentenced to be “hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God” (Joshua 9:23).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
One night Solomon has a dream in which the Lord speaks to him. In the days of Solomon’s father David, the will of the Lord had been revealed to men through the prophets Nathan and Gad (2 Sam. 7:2–17 12:1–14 24:11–14), and through special services rendered by the priests (1 Sam. 23:9–12 30:7, 8). God knew well what Solomon needed, but He bade him ask. The incident was to be a test to the young king. By the nature of his request Solomon would reveal the nature of his heart. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Solomon compares himself as a child. He is not here conveying the thought that he is a child in years, but that he regards himself as a child in experience. The words are those of humility. With the heavy responsibilities of the nation resting upon him, he felt himself unequal to the task and in need of divine help. At the time of his accession he was already married and probably a father. This is suggested by the fact that he had a son 41 years old (2 Chron. 12:13) at the time of his death, after a reign of 40 years (1 Kings 11:42). So, he asks God for an understanding heart.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
God is pleased when man requests of Him that which is wise and good. It brings joy to the heart of God for man to relate himself wisely to the issues of life.&lt;BR /&gt;
Solomon’s wisdom seems to have been both moral and intellectual. It was wisdom of a practical kind, concerning all departments of life, concerning the things and the hearts of men and the works and thoughts of the Creator. In his dream the Lord assures him of his wish. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This was not simply a dream, but a dream from God. Solomon had every assurance that the dream was of divine inspiration, and that he had come in touch with God. So certain was he that this was the case that immediately upon his return to the capital, he went before the ark and offered sacrifices to God. The sequel shows beyond question that he was right, and that he had had a message direct from the Lord.</article>

    <shortdescription>1 Kings 6:1 outlines a specific beginning to the temple of Solomon being built, which places the Exodus around 1450 B.C. Some view the 480 years as a symbolic number of 12 generations of 25 yrs. each so they date the Exodus much later (1290 B.C.).</shortdescription>
    <article>In 1 Kings 1 the time of Solomon's building of the temple is tied to when the Israelites left Egypt. This verse synchronizes the 480th year from the Exodus with the 4th year of Solomon’s reign. This information is of prime importance, for upon it may be based the Hebrew chronological reckoning from Solomon back to Moses, and earlier. On the accuracy of the b.c. date assigned to the 4th year of Solomon depends the accuracy of all other dates based upon it. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
There is no evidence for taking 480 as a round number or as 12 generations, and none for making it cover the time of the judges by totaling the years of all the judges and omitting the years of oppression or foreign rule. It should be noted that this chronological item, “in the four hundred and eightieth year,” is given formally and categorically, without any hesitation or reserve, and with unusual precision precession. Not only the year of Solomon and of the Exodus era, but also the month, is given. It is evidently meant to be an exact synchronism, such as 2 Kings 18:9, 10 Jer. 25:1 etc.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Solomon’s decision to build the Temple was not an arbitrary, self-devised act, nor was it prompted solely through the wish and will of his father David. The motive that prompted Solomon was not personal ambition, the love of glory or pomp, but the carrying out of the purpose of Heaven. The hour had clearly come for the house of the Lord to be built, and Solomon gave himself whole-heatedly to the task. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The period was one of rest and peace, both within the nation of Israel and among the nations round about. It was a time also of prosperity, enabling Solomon to secure the necessary materials. The people were able and willing to build. The account of the building of Solomon’s Temple is found also in 2 Chron. 3 and 4, but the record in Kings is the older and the more complete. The parallel account in 2 Chronicles agrees with it in all essential details. Although this account is significantly briefer than that in Kings, it contains some supplementary details.</article>

    <shortdescription>God's second appearance to Solomon, as he appeared in Gibeon, is to tell of the blessings promised to David. These promises are conditional on obedience to the Lord. The temple itself would endure if Israel would remain faithful.</shortdescription>
    <article>Work on the Temple was begun in Solomon’s 4th year (ch. 6:1), and was completed 7 years later, in his 11th year (ch. 6:38). The building of the palace took another 13 years (ch. 7:1). Thus Solomon’s combined building program of Temple and palace took 20 years (ch. 9:10 2 Chron. 8:1), being completed in the 24th year of his reign. A question arises concerning the exact meaning of the words, “when Solomon had finished.” Does this mean that it was not till the end of the 20-year period of building that the Lord appeared to Solomon with the message that his prayer offered at the dedication of the Temple had been heard? If so, then when was the Temple dedicated shortly after its completion, or after a wait of 13 years, till the entire building program had been completed? &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
If the Temple was dedicated shortly after its completion, would the Lord wait 13 years before telling Solomon that his prayer had been answered? Or could it be that the dedication did not take place till 13 years after the completion of the Temple? These are questions that, because of the brevity of the narrative, we are not able to answer with absolute certainty. It appears, however, that the response to the prayer of Solomon came shortly after the utterance of that prayer.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
God had first appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, given at Gibeon early in his reign (ch. 3:4–15). Again he was given a night vision but this message presents a contrast to the message of the earlier vision. Then the predominant theme was one of promise and encouragement (chs. 3:12–14 6:12, 13) now again there were promises and encouragement, but there were also solemn warnings of the sad results that transgression would bring. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Solomon was given the assurance that his words of earnest entreaty had been heard. He had done everything within his power to encourage the people to be faithful to the Lord and His commands. God honored his spirit and his purpose, and now gave him a new assurance of divine favor. How often the Lord gives His children renewed expressions of confidence, fresh appearances from on high, commendations for the services of earlier days, and promises of favor and blessing for days to come.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
All God’s promises of blessing are conditional upon obedience. It could not be otherwise. The laws of nature as well as those governing moral conduct are the laws of God, and whoever violates those laws sins against himself. All God’s laws are given for the benefit of man and for the world in which he lives. When these laws are violated the inevitable result is sorrow, sickness, pain, woe, and death. This is true for the individual as well as the nation, for the community as well as the world. The pathway of obedience is the only pathway of peace and prosperity, of life and health. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The well-being of society, the peace of the nation, the hope of the world—all require that men learn the wisdom and practical worth of obedience to every command of God. When Israel still was prosperous and Solomon still was young, God desired to make it plain that transgression would not bring joy but sorrow, not blessing but disaster and death.</article>

    <shortdescription>The Bible records that Solomon "took thirteen years to build his own house so he finished all his house" (1 Kings 7:1). It goes on to list other buildings he also built. His "house" might better be termed "palace."</shortdescription>
    <article>In 1 Kings 7 we find a brief description of Solomon’s building activities in connection with his own palace. The word “house” as here used no doubt means not a single structure but the complex of buildings connected with the palace. There were many of these, the exact nature or purpose of which is largely a matter of conjecture. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Undoubtedly they included most of the structures usually connected with a royal palace, such as halls of state, judgment halls, the royal residence, residence for the queen, armory, etc. These must have constituted a large group of buildings enclosed in a great court. All structures of the time of Solomon were built on the two hills between the Kidron and Tyropoeon valleys—Mt. Moriah and Mt. Zion—in fact, there were no buildings west of the Tyropoeon Valley until the later kings.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Bible says he took 13 years to complete his work. The 13 years are to be counted from the end of the 7 years when the Temple was completed, in Solomon’s 11th year of reign (ch. 6:38). His whole period of building thus occupied 20 years (1 Kings 9:10 2 Chron. 8:1), from the 4th year of his reign to the 24th. The building of the Temple took only seven years because it was a single structure, and a long period of preparation had preceded the actual building (1 Chron. 22:2–4). However, the palace complex consisted of a large range of buildings for which previous preparation could not have been made to any extent.</article>

    <shortdescription>Hiram is given 20 cities in Galilee as pay from Solomon for all the work on the temple and the palace. Hiram is not pleased, probably hoping for more fertile lands. He later gives Solomon 120 talents of gold, about 4 1/2 tons.</shortdescription>
    <article>Solomon is building for 20 years. These 20 years begin with the 4th year of Solomon (ch. 6:1), when he began to build the Temple. They include the 7 years employed in the work on the Temple (ch. 6:38) and the 13 years during which his own house was built (ch. 7:1). The gold that Hiram gave to Solomon may not have been provided at the time the Temple was built, but was probably the 120 talents mentioned in v. 14. After 20 years of building, Solomon’s treasury was doubtless considerably depleted, and as a result Solomon turned to Hiram, who may have agreed to provide the gold in return for certain cities from Solomon. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Solomon gives Hiram 20 cities in the land of Galilee. These cities are not mentioned in the compact made between Solomon and Hiram, whereby Hiram was to furnish timber and labor for activities connected with the building of the Temple, and was to receive in return certain provisions of food (1 Kings 5:5–11). Nor is anything said in the original agreement about Hiram’s providing Solomon with gold. According to the strict provisions of the Mosaic code, Solomon had no right to give away these cities (Lev. 25:23). But such are the necessities of a worldly policy that technical provisions of the law are easily set aside. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The region was to the northwest of the Sea of Galilee. The western portion of this territory would be near the frontiers of Tyre, and so would suit the purposes of both Hiram and Solomon. It appears that at the time the compact was made, these cities were populated by native inhabitants of the land rather than Israelites, for it was 20 years after the return of these cities to Solomon that men of Israel were caused by their king to dwell there (2 Chron. 8:2). Hiram was not pleased with the cities. Hiram probably had cast his eyes on the bay of Accho, or on some rich grain lands, and was disappointed when he received a group of inferior inland towns. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It seems that Hiram refused Solomon’s gift, and never even took possession of the cities. Solomon’s yearly income was 666 talents of gold (ch. 10:14). Thus the sum received from Hiram would be about one sixth of Solomon’s annual income. It is impossible to fix the exact monetary value of the talent. An estimate would make the weight of the talent approximately 34.2 kg., or 75.4 lb.</article>

    <article>In 2 Chron. 8:11 a reason is given for this removal: “Because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of the Lord hath come.” Since the ark had been brought into the City of David (2 Sam. 6:12), Solomon evidently regarded the entire area as sacred and not suitable for the house of his foreign wife. It has been suggested that the new royal quarters were probably on the hill west of the Temple area, with the Tyropoeon Valley between them.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Solomon’s marriage to the Egyptian princess was in direct violation of the command of God (Deut. 17:17). The fact that she was converted and that she joined her husband in the worship of God did not justify the disregard for the divine requirements. The seemingly advantageous alliance thus formed with Egypt led to more alliances with surrounding nations. Marriages were entered into with heathen princesses that finally led Solomon away from God and into idolatry. More and more he wandered into the ways of the world, seeking for grandeur and glory, and forsaking the principles of righteousness. From a wise, God-fearing king, Solomon degenerated into a foolish, ambitious, oppressive tyrant.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Solomon enters a glorious part of his reign when he builds up the fortification of Jerusalem and also many cities. The word "Millo" means filling and may have referred to an area between the hills of Zion and Moriah or it may have been a citadel.</shortdescription>
    <article>In 1 Kings 9:15-28 it consists of brief historical and explanatory notes, but it contains some items of great value. The levy here referred to was mentioned in ch. 5:13, 14. This labor draft was first for the building of the Temple and then for the palace and other enterprises. The reference to work on the "Millo" is thought to be a citadel, terrace, or fortification in Jerusalem. Since David dwelt in the “fort,” or “castle,” of the old Jebusite city captured by him, later known as the “city of David” (2 Sam. 5:7, 9, 1 Chron. 11:5, 7), Millo was probably a strong place in the city when it was taken by David. It was probably situated at the northern end of the city. David (2 Sam. 5:9 1 Chron. 11:8) and Solomon (1 Kings 9:24 11:27) added to the early fortification, and later Hezekiah did additional work (2 Chron. 32:5). Others have explained Millo to be the earth filling along the eastern slope south of Moriah.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
David greatly strengthened and extended the walls of the ancient Jebusite city, building “round about from Millo and inward” (2 Sam. 5:9). Solomon made further repairs and additions, closing up certain weak points of defense in the City of David (1 Kings 11:27). Later kings continued to make repairs and additions, till the wall eventually ran near the Valley of Hinnom at the south (Jer. 19:2), including a double wall at the southeast near the king’s garden (2 Kings 25:4), a wall outside the City of David on the east, “on the west side of Gihon, in the valley” and which went “about Ophel” and was raised to “a very great height” (2 Chron. 33:14). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The gate at the northwest corner was an important gate called the “gate of the corner” (Jer. 31:38). It was a section of this northern wall, “from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits” (2 Kings 14:13), that was broken down by Jehoash of Israel during the reign of Amaziah. Uzziah repaired and strengthened the wall, building towers at the “the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them” (2 Chron. 26:9). The rest of the chapter lists other great accomplishments of Solomon.</article>

    <shortdescription>The Queen of Sheba from the ancient kingdom of Sabea hears of Solomon's great wealth and wisdom. She pays a visit and tests him with difficult questions. She sees all his fame and fortune and leaves very impressed.</shortdescription>
    <article>In 1 Kings 10 we read of the visit of the Queen of Sheba to see Solomon's glorious kingdom. There has been considerable difference of opinion as to the country over which this queen ruled. Both Arabia and Ethiopia have claims to such a name and such a queen. The expression “queen of the south,” applied to the queen of Sheba in Matt. 12:42, would apply equally well to a queen of either Arabia or Ethiopia. Results of recent archeological researches in southern Arabia tend to identify the queen with this territory and her capital with Marib, in Yemen. The Arabian Sheba was a great spice country, and many are inclined to believe that this was the Sheba whose queen made a visit to Solomon.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
She arrived with quite a load of gifts for the king. The spices of Arabia have long been famous. In Eze. 27:22 Sheba is mentioned as trading with Tyre in spices, precious stones, and gold. The Bible says she had many questions for Solomon. Doubtless questions that had to do with diversified fields of learning. To these questions Solomon gave helpful, intelligent answers, which directed the queen’s mind to the true source of his wisdom and prosperity.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
After the queen of Sheba had witnessed Solomon’s wisdom and works, she answered, not in words that showed a mere formal appreciation for the hospitality that had been accorded her, but in words that revealed that her heart had been deeply moved. In her response she touched but lightly on all the external magnificence and evidence of worldly prosperity and placed the main emphasis on extolling the God of Solomon, who had given him his wisdom and prosperity, and his fame, which had gone throughout the world. Instead of extolling the human agent she had rightfully been led to give glory to God. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Her visit may have led to her conversion. There is reason to believe that the queen will be among the saved in the kingdom of God (Matt. 12:24). God intended that many such conversions should result from Israel playing her role among the peoples of earth. From here and there throughout the nations, men were to go to Israel and there become acquainted with Israel’s God. By such means light was to go out among all nations.</article>

    <shortdescription>After Elah is murdered Omri his captain is made the 6th king over the northern kingdom of Israel and reigns 12 years. He establishes Samaria as capital. He is powerful but does evil in God's sight. His son is Ahab.</shortdescription>
    <article>Omri, the 6th king of the northern kingdom of Israel (c. 885–c. 874 b.c.) and founder of a strong dynasty that reigned for approximately 44 years (c. 885–841 b.c.), one fifth of the duration of the kingdom. Before becoming king, Omri was an army commander of King Elah. He was engaged in fighting against the Philistines at Gibbethon when Zimri, an officer of the chariotry, assassinated Elah and usurped the throne. When this news reached the army it immediately proclaimed Omri king, and marched against Zimri at Tirzah, the capital. Zimri, recognizing that he could not hold the throne against Omri’s army, committed suicide. His length of reign was only 7 days (1 Ki 16:8–10, 15–20). However, Omri had to fight for more than 4 years against Tibni, another contender for the throne and one who had a considerable following, before he became sole ruler over Israel.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Omri’s reign was of great political importance. He moved the capital to Samaria (1 Ki 16:24), strategically a much better location than Tirzah. By selecting an entirely uninhabited site that had neither history nor tradition, Omri revealed much political wisdom and did for Israel what David had done for Judah in the selection of Jerusalem. He subjugated Moab as is attested by the *Moabite Stone of King Mesha . The inscription reads in part: "Omri, king of Israel, had oppressed Moab many days, for Kemosh was angry with his land. … And Omri had occupied the land of Mehedeba, and (Israel) dwelt therein his days and half the days of his son, 40 years." That Omri’ conquest of Moab was a profitable venture is seen from the tribute that Moab paid to his son Ahab. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It amounted, probably annually, to 100,000 lambs, and the wool of 100,000 rams (2 Ki 3:4). With his Phoenician neighbors Omri established cordial relations, and crowned these relations by marrying his son Ahab to Jezebel, the daughter of Ethbaal, king of Tyre, called "king of the Zidonians" in 1 Ki 16:31, according to ancient usage. The result of this alliance with the Phoenicians was the introduction of the worship of Baal and Asherah into Israel to an extent previously unknown (vs 32, 33).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Not much is known about Omri’s relations with the Syrians of Damascus, except that he granted economic concessions to Damascus and allowed Syrian traders to have bazaars in Samaria (1 Ki 20:34, RSV). It is unknown whether this was a purely economic agreement or a concession after a military defeat. There is no evidence of any encounters with the Assyrians, but for the next 150 years the Assyrian records refer to Israel as the "land of Omri," or the "house of Omri." &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
They call even Jehu, the exterminator of the dynasty of Omri, a "son of Omri." Omri’s personality, political success, or trading enterprises seem to have gained this fame for him in the eyes of his contemporaries and later generations. In view of this, Omri must be considered one of the most notable kings of Israel, although the Bible devotes little space to him, noting that he did "evil in the sight of the Lord," even worse "than all who were before him" (1 Ki 16:25, RSV).</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "physician" or "God has healed." He is the son of Abijah and the 3rd king of Judah. He is good king and seeks to establish the true worship of God and get rid of idolatry and immorality. He reigns for 41 years and is succeeded by his son.</shortdescription>
    <article>Asa, name possibly means "Myrtle," "physician," or "(Yahweh) has healed." The third king of Judah, the southern kingdom, who reigned for 41 years (c. 911–c. 869 b.c.). He was a good king, and made strong efforts to purify the religion of his people. He removed his "mother" (actually grandmother), Maachah, the daughter of Absalom, from the powerful office of queen mother, because she had made an image to Asherah. Asa destroyed not only this image but also the idols of his predecessors and all strange altars and sun images. He cleared the country of its male cult prostitutes (sodomites) and of many high places. The people continued to use the remaining high places for worship (1 Ki 15:9–14 2 Chr 14:1–5 15:16, 17). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The first 10 years of his reign were peaceful, and were used to strengthen the country’s fortifications and the army (2 Chr 14:1, 6–8). Hence he was ready for, and able to repulse, the invasion of Zerah and his great host of Africans (vs 9–15). In his 15th regnal year, with the help of the prophet Azariah, the son of Oded, he carried out a great religious reformation. He rededicated the altar of burnt offering in the Temple and caused the people to renew their covenant with God (ch 15:1–15). In the 36th year (probably the 36th year after the division of the kingdom) Baasha of Israel invaded Benjamin and began to fortify Ramah on the main road from Jerusalem to the north, thus blocking Judah’s northern exit. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Feeling that he was not strong enough to meet Baasha’s threat by force, Asa offered Ben-hadad I of Damascus a heavy tribute as an inducement to attack Israel. Ben-hadad accepted the offer and forced Baasha to withdraw from Ramah. Asa then took the building material left by Baasha at Ramah and with it built Geba and Mizpah (1 Ki 15:16–22 2 Chr 16:1–6). Asa’s act of seeking foreign aid displeased God, who sent His prophet Hanani to reprove the king. Asa rejected this message and jailed Hanani. He also mistreated other well-meaning subjects during the latter part of his reign (2 Chr 16:7–10). The last years of his reign were marked by severe suffering through disease in his feet. During this time he apparently let his son Jehoshaphat act as coregent and take care of administrative duties. Asa was buried in a tomb that he had prepared for himself in Jerusalem (1 Ki 15:23 2 Chr 16:12–14).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "generous." He is the son of Jeroboam I and the 2nd king of Israel. He reigns for less than two years and is a wicked king like his father. While attacking Gebbethon he is killed by Baasha who then takes his throne.</shortdescription>
    <article>Nadab, name means "generous." Son and successor of Jeroboam I, and the 2d king of the northern kingdom of Israel. He reigned for less than 2 years (c. 910–909 b.c.) and followed his father in all his evil ways (1 Ki 15:25, 26). While besieging Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines at that time, he was killed by Baasha, who then usurped the throne for himself and afterward exterminated all the relatives of the house of Jeroboam (vs 27–29). This massacre fulfilled Ahija’s prophecy concerning Jeroboam (ch 14:10, 11).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "bravery." He is the son of Ahijah and the 3rd king of Israel. The city of Tirzah is his capital and he is buried there after reigning 24 years. He is a wicked king. Because of idolatry, Jehu predicts his house will be destroyed.</shortdescription>
    <article>Baasha. The son of Ahijah, of the tribe of Issachar, the 3rd king of the northern kingdom of Israel. He acquired the throne by slaying King Nadab during a siege of the Philistine city of Gibbethon (1 Ki 15:27, 28). One of the first acts of his reign was to exterminate all remaining relatives of Jeroboam I, thus fulfilling the prophet Ahijah’s prediction (vs 29, 30 ch 14:10, 11). The 24 years of Baasha’s reign (c. 909–c. 886 b.c.) were marked by wickedness (1 Ki 15:34) and by continual warfare with the southern kingdom (v 32). His attempt to build up Ramah as a military fortress within the border of Judah failed when Asa of Judah hired Ben-hadad I of Damascus against him (1 Ki 15:16–21 2 Chr 16:1–6). The prophet Jehu predicted the extermination of Baasha’s dynasty (1 Ki 16:1–4).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "Yahweh knows." High priest during the reigns of Queen Athaliah and King Joash of Judah. His wife is Jehosheba who hides the infant prince Joash in the temple for 6 years when Athaliah slays the royal children.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jehoiada, name means "Yahweh knows." The high priest during the reigns of Queen Athaliah and King Joash of Judah. He was married to Jehosheba, or Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram and sister of King Ahaziah (2 Ki 11:2 2 Chr 22:11). When Athaliah usurped the throne after her son’s death, she slew all the royal children except the infant prince Joash whom Jehoiada’s wife rescued and concealed in the Temple for 6 years. At the end of this period Jehoiada proclaimed Joash, his nephew, king and slew Athaliah (2 Ki 11:1–16 2 Chr 22:10 to 2 Chr 23:15). He then led the people to make a covenant with God and with the king (2 Ki 11:17), and was instrumental in causing the destruction of the Baal temple (v 18). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
For many years he exercised a good influence on the young king, so that Joash followed God as long as his uncle lived (2 Chr 24:2). Jehoiada died at the age of 130, and in recognition of his service to the nation he was buried among the kings of Judah in the City of David (vs 15, 16). Joash revealed shocking ingratitude after Jehoida’s death not only by allowing the people to relapse into idolatry but also by stoning his benefactor’s son, Zechariah, who cried out against the people’s return to idolatry (vs 17–22).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Jeroboam sets up new centers of worship in the divided northern kingdom in Dan &amp; Bethel and creates two golden calves for people to worship. An unknown prophet of Judah condemns the altar in Bethel and Jeroboam's hand withers and the altar splits.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jeroboam was officiating as priest at the dedication of the new altar at Bethel, endeavoring to invest it with a sanctity that would win for it the homage and respect of the people, God could not allow the king’s bold defiance to go unrebuked. An unknown prophet from Judah steps on the scene.  &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
So that Jeroboam and the people might be impressed that the man of God was a true phophet and that his message of warning carried weight, he gave a striking prophecy, which would be immediately fulfilled. It is dangerous for anyone, whoever he be, to lift up his hand against a man sent with a solemn message from God. The stretched-forth arm was immediately smitten, to strike terror into the hearts of both king and people, and to impress them anew that they had before them a true prophet of God. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The altar also split in two. This manifestation of the Lord’s presence and power was something that could not be successfully gainsaid. Instead of being persuaded of the solemnity of the altar and the sanctity of their priestly king, the people now realized that Jeroboam was acting in direct defiance of Heaven and bringing upon himself the divine rebuke.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The king had been humbled. He had also been brought to a realization that he was dealing with a man of God, who, under the circumstances, alone could release him from his present plight. The restoration of the arm on the submission of the king and the prayer of the prophet was designed to give Jeroboam another opportunity for repentance. He had not yet gone too far for the Lord to forgive. If the king had been willing to go all the way, and had asked for a restoration of heart as well as of hand, the way would have been opened for a return of the nation of God and a mighty reform throughout the land of Israel.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The offer of the king was prompted not by gratitude but by policy. An acceptance of hospitality and reward would in the eyes of the people imply that the prophet condoned the king’s course and would serve to destroy the solemn impression that he had made. He would also have created an unfavorable impression regarding his character and mission. The resolute refusal to receive the king’s proffered reward placed the prohet on vantage ground and made a deep impression upon both king and people.</article>

    <shortdescription>Rehoboam reigns in Judah for 17 years, in Jerusalem. During this time "Judah did evil in the sight of the Lord" (1 Kings 14:22). In 2 Chron. 12:1 it says he "forsook the law of the Lord."</shortdescription>
    <article>During the reign of Rehoboam, Judah did evil. The primary motive in the records in Kings seems to be to disclose the part each individual played in the religious history of the kingdom. In the cases of certain kings the information is that it was the ruler who did evil (2 Kings 17:2 21:2, 20 23:32, 37 24:9, 19), but in the case of Rehoboam the record states that "Judah did evil." The apostasy in Judah was evidently the harvest of the deadly seed sown by the evil example of Solomon, under whose idolatry the young men of the nation had grown up. Rehoboam was weak and vacillating, and did not take the initiative in restraining the people when they did wrong.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
There were repeated commands to destroy the pillars erected by the Canaanites, as well as to cut down and burn their groves (Ex. 23:24 34:13 Deut. 7:5 12:3 see on Deut. 16:22). The pillars erected by Jacob (Gen. 28:18 31:13 35:14) were not objects of worship (see on Gen. 28:18). There were also male temple prostitutes. They carried on their abominable trade under a religious sanction. It was for the practice of such abominations as these that the ancient inhabitants of the land were to be cast out, and now the people of Judah were rivaling them in wickedness (see 1 Kings 15:12 2 Kings 23:7).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>With Rehoboam's kingdom divided, Shishak I, the king of Egypt invades Palestine and takes away the treasuries of Jerusalem built up during the time of David and Solomon. He leaves records of his exploits on the temple walls of Karnak.</shortdescription>
    <article>&lt;b&gt;Shishak.&lt;/b&gt; Known in Egyptian history as Sheshonk I. He was the founder of Egypt’s Twenty-second Dynasty. He made his famous raid against Judah in the fifth year of Rehoboam. This record is remarkably confirmed by the celebrated inscription at Karnak, enumerating the conquests of Sheshonk and listing cities captured on that campaign. Among the places that can be identified are many within the borders of Israel, chiefly in the plain of Esdraelon, such as Taanach, Megiddo, Beth-shan, Shunem, and others. Socoh and Arad are the only well-known towns in Judah whose names have been read. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Some have thought that at the time of this attack, the aforenamed cities in Israel had been captured and were being held by Rehoboam, with the result that Jeroboam invited his former protector to effect a rescue. It is more probable that Sheshonk had certain grievances against Jeroboam, who may not have fulfilled promises made before he became king over Israel. The fragment of a victory stele found in the excavation of Megiddo indicates that Sheshonk dealt with that city as conquered and not liberated. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
There is a touch of pathos in this looting of the Temple treasures, which David and Solomon had so laboriously gathered and which were the glory of all Israel. But this sad experience was only a foretaste of sadder days yet to come. The fact that the shields of brass were committed to the chief of the guard indicates that the golden shields had been for the use of the guard on state occasions.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "father's brother." He is the son of Omri and 7th king of Israel. His wife is Jezebel who is an evil influence and encourages Baal worship. He is strongly rebuked by Elijah and seeks to kill him. Famous for battle with Ben-Hadad.</shortdescription>
    <article>Ahab, name means "father’s brother." The 8th king (if Tibni is included in the count) of the northern kingdom of Israel, son and successor of Omri. He reigned 22 years, from 874 to 853 b.c. He was married to Jezebel, the daughter of Ethbaal, "king of the Zidonians" (1 Ki 16:31). He was a strong military leader, keeping the Moabites in subjection (2 Ki 3:4, 5 Moabite Stone, line 8). He lived on friendly terms with the Phoenicians and kept peace with Judah, whose crown prince married Ahab’s daughter Athaliah (2 Ki 8:18, 26). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
He defeated the Syrians twice in battle, and possessed the largest army of any nation lying between Assyria and Egypt. When Benhadad II of Damascus with 32 allies besieged Samaria, Ahab drove him back (1 Ki 20:1–21) and a year later inflicted an even more severe defeat on him in the battle of Aphek (vs 22–30), and captured him. Ahab, however, showed himself foolishly magnanimous and spared Benhadad’s life, even released him. Benhadad promised to return certain cities which his father had conquered from Ahab’s father, Omri, or possibly, as some think, Baasha (see ch 15:18–22), and also made economic concessions by allowing Israelite merchants to open shops in the bazaars of Damascus (ch 20:31–34, RSV).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When the Assyrians under Shalmaneser III threatened to end the independence of the small states in Syria and Palestine, a coalition of 12 nations was formed under the leadership of Damascus to meet the common enemy. Shalmaneser’s inscriptions show that of the allied armies Ahab (called A'abbu mat Sir’ilâ, "Ahab the Israelite") had the largest chariot force, 2,000 out of a total of 3,940, and a formidable infantry of 10,000 foot soldiers out of a total of about 60,000. The battle (which is not mentioned in the Bible) took place at Qarqar on the Orontes in central Syria in Shalmaneser’s 6th year, which can be dated, with a great degree of certainty, in 853 b.c. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The record of Ahab’s participation in this battle helps to provide the earliest synchronism between Biblical and secular history (see Chronology, V, 3). While the allies won no decisive victory, the Assyrians were forced to retreat and leave Syria temporarily unconquered. As soon as the common threat was averted, the alliance broke up, and the old feuds between the various small nations in Syria and Palestine were continued. Ahab also set out at once to take the city of Ramot-hgilead from the Aramaeans of Syria, who had occupied it for some time. In a battle for this city Ahab was mortally wounded (1 Ki 22:2–36). His body was taken to Samaria for burial, and, as the Lord had predicted through Elijah (ch 21:19), the dogs licked Ahab’s blood, which had stained the chariot (ch 22:38).</article>

    <shortdescription>Jeroboam's son, Abijah gets sick. The king sends his wife to Shiloh to ask Ahijah the prophet what will happen to the child. His wife disguises herself but the prophet knows she is coming. He predicts disaster on the king's house and the child dies.</shortdescription>
    <article>The event is selected to show the persistence of Jeroboam in his course of evil and the judgments that were to fall upon him and his house as a result. The name of the son, Abijah, means "Jehovah is my father," and is probably an indication that when the child was born, Jeroboam did not intend to forsake the worship of Jehovah. The coincidence of the name with that of Rehoboam’s son, Abijam (v. 31), or Abijah (2 Chron. 12:16), is of interest. Possibly it is more than a coincidence, since the births of the two sons may have taken place at about the same time, when Jeroboam was in favor with Solomon.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Previously Ahijah had been sent to Jeroboam with the cheering words that he was to be king, and that if faithful, the Lord would be with him and give him a sure house (ch. 11:38). But Jeroboam had not obeyed the Lord’s commands he had grievously sinned and had led Israel into sin. At a time when the king was looking for a word of hope, God could give him only a message of rebuke. Jeroboam had before him the example of Solomon’s wayward life. Indeed he had received his kingdom because it had been taken away from Solomon’s son, Rehoboam. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jeroboam therefore stood without excuse before God and before all Israel. There had been sinners among the leaders of Israel before the days of Jeroboam, but none to equal Jeroboam in his gross iniquities. Jeroboam repudiated the God who had given him the kingdom, serving idols instead. The warnings that had been given, he contemptuously spurned. God’s inheritance had been placed in his hands as a sacred trust, but he failed to be true. The people of Israel were deliberately led into sin, encouraged to turn their backs on the Lord, who had delivered them from Egypt and given them the Promised Land.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
All the males of the family of Jeroboam were to be put to death, so that his house would perish. This was done by Baasha (ch. 15:29). The phrase used to denote males was a common expression of the period, from the time of David (1 Sam. 25:22, 34), through Baasha (1 Kings 16:11), to Ahab (1 Kings 21:21 2 Kings 9:8), and is a term of contempt applied to such males as are doomed to utter destruction. The prophet says their child shall die. Scarcely a message to comfort a mother’s aching heart or for a father anxiously hoping for the healing of his child. The death of the child was to be to Jeroboam a type of the doom of his house, which, if he continued in his evil ways, would be utterly destroyed. Perhaps the death of this son might so touch the heart of the king as to bring him to reason and to God.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name is more often Abijah which means "Yahweh is a father." The son of Rehoboam, he rules Judah for 3 years. He is a descendent of Absalom and is a wicked king like his father. He is victorious in a battle against Israel, relying on the Lord.</shortdescription>
    <article>Abijah, name means "Yahweh is a father". &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The second king of Judah after Solomon, called Abijam by the author of Kings. He was the son of Rehoboam and ruled Judah 3 years (c. 913–c. 911 b.c.). Through his mother he was a descendant of Absalom (1 Ki 15:2). He followed his father in wickedness, and also continued the war with Jeroboam I (vs 3, 6, 7). In a certain battle, because he "relied upon the Lord God" he was able to inflict a crushing defeat upon Israel (2 Chr 13:3–20). He had 14 wives, 22 sons, and 16 daughters (v 21). His biography was written by the prophet Iddo (v 22). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The apparent discrepancy in the maternity of Abijah (1 Ki 15:2 cf. 2 Chr 13:2) is generally explained as follows: "Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom," or Absalom, was really the granddaughter, not daughter, of Absalom. The Hebrew word for daughter may refer to any female descendant no matter how remote.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "praise." He murders Elah and usurps the throne of Israel as 5th king. He reigns only 7 days. When he hears Omri is named king and is coming to attack him, he burns down his house and commits suicide.</shortdescription>
    <article>Zimri, name may mean "my praise" or an abbreviated form of Zimrîyah, "my praise is Yahweh". The 5th king of the northern kingdom of Israel, who reigned only 7 days (c. b.c.). He was commander of one half of King Elah’s chariot forces when he plotted against the king and slew him at Tirzah. He usurped the throne and exterminated the whole house of his predecessor, thus fulfilling a prophecy made to Baasha by the prophet Jehu (1 Ki 16:9–15). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When the news of Zimri’s acts reached the army that was besieging Gibbethon at that time, they proclaimed the commander, Omri, king by acclamation, and at once marched against Zimri at Tirzah. The city was taken after a short siege, and Zimri committed suicide by burning the palace over him (vs 15–18). Some commentators have identified him with Zimri, thinking that he tried to bring the kingdom back to the house of Saul.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "God has judged." He is the son of Asa and Azubah, the 4th king of the southern kingdom of Judah. He reigns 25 years partly with his father, and is a righteous king who teaches the Law. Sometimes joined with Ahab, for which he is rebuked.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jehoshaphat, name means "Yahweh has judged. The 4th king of the southern kingdom of Judah, who reigned 25 years (c. 872–c. 848 b.c.). There is reason to believe that he was associated with his father Asa on the throne during Asa’s last regnal years when the elder monarch was plagued by a foot disease. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jehoshaphat’s son, Jehoram was coregent with his father toward the end of Jehoshaphat’s reign (2 Ki 8:16 cf. ch 1:17 2 Chr 20:31). Jehoshaphat’s sole rule lasted only about 17 years. He is described as a good king who did not serve foreign gods, although many of his subjects still worshiped at high places that had not been removed (1 Ki 22:43 2 Chr 17:3). In his 3rd year he sent princes, Levites, and priests through the country of Judah to teach the people the principles of the Law of God (2 Chr 17:7–9). God blessed him because of these things. He was able to make peace with Israel and also to gain the respect and favor of the surrounding nations, some of whom sent him gifts (1 Ki 22:44 2 Chr 17:11). It was regrettable that he connected his house with that of Omri of Israel, by taking Athaliah, the idolatrous daughter of Ahab, as wife for his son (2 Ki 8:18).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
While visiting Ahab after the battle of Qarqar in 853 b.c. Jehoshaphat was induced by the Israelite king to accompany him on a campaign to regain Ramoth-gilead from the Syrians. The campaign was unsuccessful and in the ensuing battle Ahab was mortally wounded, but Jehoshaphat escaped (1 Ki 22:1–38 2 Chr 18:1–34). Jehoshaphat’s fraternization with the wicked king of Israel was severely rebuked by the prophet Jehu, son of Hanani (2 Chr 19:1, 2). Returning from the north, Jehoshaphat continued the religious and judicial reforms started by his father (1 Ki 22:46 2 Chr 17:6). He also instituted a judicial body in Jerusalem to act as the highest court in the country (2 Chr 19:4–11). He is called Josaphat in Mt 1:18, KJV.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Later in his reign the Ammonites, Moabites, and Edomites joined forces and invaded Judah from the south. Jehoshaphat sought the Lord for deliverance, and the Lord honored his request. The enemy allies began quarreling among themselves and in a bloody battle destroyed one another (2 Chr 20:1–30). It was probably this disaster that gave Jehoshaphat access to the Edomite fort of Ezion-geber, seemingly not occupied by Judah since the time of Solomon. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Ahaziah of Israel joined him in an enterprise to build a fleet of ships to be used for trading expeditions. But the ships were wrecked, presumably in a gale. Ahaziah seems to have suggested a second attempt, but Jehoshaphat refused, for he had been rebuked by the prophet Eliezer for uniting himself with the wicked king of Israel (1 Ki 22:48, 49 2 Chr 20:35–37). Later, Jehoshaphat joined Jehoram, another son of Ahab, in a campaign against Moab which met with a measure of success (2 Ki 3:4–27). Jehoshaphat was buried in the royal tombs of Jerusalem (2 Chr 21:1).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "the LORD is my God." He is a Tishbite and probably the greatest spiritual reformer of all Scripture. He works in Israel's northern kingdom during the time of Ahab and Jezebel. He speaks against Baal worship, an shows victory on Mt. Carmel</shortdescription>
    <article>Elijah, name means "Yahweh is my God". God’s special messenger to the northern kingdom of Israel during the great apostasy under Ahab (c. 874–853 b.c.) and Jezebel, when Baal worship practically supplanted the worship of the true God. He is identified only as "the Tishbite" (1 Ki 17:1). A man of great faith in God and bold zeal for God, Elijah easily qualifies among the greatest of the prophets. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The high esteem in which the Jews of later centuries held Elijah is evident from the popular expectation, based on the prediction of Mal 4:5, 6 that the prophet would return to earth to herald the imminent appearance of the Messiah (see Mt 17:10–12). Jesus identified the ministry of John the Baptist with that predicted by Malachi (ch 11:14), having already declared that there was none greater than John (v 11). So far as is known, Elijah was the only person, except Enoch, ever honored by translation to heaven without seeing death (2 Ki 2:11, 12). He was also chosen to accompany Moses, the great lawgiver, at the transfiguration of Christ (Mt 17:3).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When Ahab began his reign, a little more than half a century had passed since the death of Solomon and the division of the kingdom, since which time Israel, the northern kingdom, had rapidly lapsed into apostasy. But Ahab "did evil in the sight of the Lord above all that were before him," in that he married Jezebel, daughter of a Phoenician king, and adopted her religion, thus becoming a worshiper of Baal (1 Ki 16:30, 31). Not only so, but he erected a temple to Baal in Samaria (vs 32, 33) and thus "Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him" (v 33). Such were conditions when the Lord commissioned Elijah to visit Ahab at court and announce a severe drought of unspecified duration (ch 17:1) as remedial punishment. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The intensity of the famine and the gravity with which Ahab viewed the situation are reflected in the apprehensive reaction of Obadiah, the officer over Ahab’s house, to whom Elijah presented himself (vs 7–14). Ahab’s initial challenge upon meeting Elijah, "Art thou he that troubleth Israel?" was promptly silenced by the divine indictment that Ahab himself was to blame for the plight of the nation, and by the order for the king to appear forthwith on Mount Carmel, together with all the prophets of Baal and Asherah (1 Ki 18:17–19). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
On Carmel the issue of Baal versus the Lord as the true God was put to a dramatic test designed to bring king and people to a decision in the matter (vs 20–40). The people acknowledged the Lord as the true God, and at the command of Elijah slew all the prophets of Baal (vs 39, 40). Then, to prove that the drought had been a divine judgment upon the land, and as a sequel to the people’s admission that the Lord is the true God, an abundance of rain fell (vs 41–46).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Enraged at the turn of events, Jezebel threatened the prophet’s life, with the result that he took refuge in hasty flight southward to the Wilderness of Sinai, where he lodged in a cave once more he was miraculously sustained (1 Ki 19:1–9). When summoned by the Lord to account for his inglorious flight from the threat to his life by Jezebel, Elijah protested that he alone of all Israel had remained loyal to God, and that now even his life was in jeopardy (vs 10–14). Thereupon God tactfully rebuked His erring prophet and appointed him further tasks—the anointing of Jehu as king of Israel in the place of Ahab, of Hazael as the scourge of Israel because of its apostasy, and of Elisha as Elijah’s successor (vs 15–21).</article>

        <VideoDescription>What does the last Old Testament prophecy of Elijah returning mean? The Bible teaches that John the Baptist came in the spirit and power of Elijah. There is no greater prophet for he introduced the Messiah. We too must hear the call of Elijah to our hearts and turn to Jesus. Baptism symbolizes our commitment to Christ.</VideoDescription>

Ahab then began to covet the land and Jezebel, his wife stirred him up to take the land from him.  The devil wants to do the same thing with us, he wants us to give up the inheritance that God gives to us.</VideoDescription>

    <shortdescription>Name means "shining." He is an "Ethiopian" and commander of Egypt's Nubian forces who attempts to plunder Jerusalem like Shishak with a great host, but is defeated in the battle at Mareshah.</shortdescription>
    <article>Zerah the Ethiopian. As yet we have not been able to identify Zerah from contemporary records. Since there were Cushites in western Arabia and eastern Africa bordering on the Red Sea (see Gen. 10:6), Zerah may have been from that region. He may have had Libyan auxiliary forces in his army, from Egypt, where a Libyan dynasty ruled. Asa had done what he could to build up the national defenses and train an army (2 Chron. 14:6–8). So when Zerah struck, Judah was ready.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Asa had prepared cities of defense and he had a large and well-equipped army. But his trust was not alone in arms or men, but in God. As he faced the enemy, he did so in the name of the Lord and as a representative of God. Facing Zerah in the name of the Lord, Asa felt that his own defeat would be a defeat for the Lord. The Lord enabled Asa to gain an amazing victory. Judah had powerful enemies, both to the north and to the south. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Left to herself she would quickly have succumbed before the superior might of the forces arrayed against her. But with God’s help she was invincible. The attack of Zerah was the last serious threat that Judah was to meet from the south. Henceforth her enemies were from the north—first, Assyria under Sennacherib, and then Babylon under Nebuchadnezzar, who brought the nation down in ruin.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "son of the god Hadad." He is probably the son of Ben-Hadad I and ruler over Damascus who fights against Ahab of Israel and is not successful in besieging Samaria. Ahab unwisely frees him at a second battle. Hazael murders him.</shortdescription>
    <article>Ben-hadad, name means "son of (the god) Hadad." Ben-hadad II, probably son and successor of Ben-hadad I. He ruled over Damascus from c. 870 to c. 842 b.c. He fought against Ahab of Israel and unsuccessfully besieged Samaria. He was also beaten in the battle of Aphek in a second attempt to subjugate Israel. In this battle he was captured, but Ahab spared his life after the king promised to return to Israel the conquered cities of Galilee, to admit business firms of Israel to Damascus, and to enter into a treaty (1 Ki 20:1–34). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Probably this treaty was an alliance against Assyria, for in 853 b.c. both Ahab and Ben-hadad fought as allies in the battle of Qarqar against Shalmaneser III. The battle was not decisive, and the allies were not beaten into submission. Shalmaneser III mentions three further campaigns against Damascus during Ben-hadad’s reign (849, 848, 845 b.c.), but they seem to have had no lasting success. The alliance of Damascus and Israel was short-lived. In the same year that the battle of Qarqar was fought Ahab waged war against Ben-hadad and was killed at Ramoth-gilead. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Later Ben-hadad invaded Israel again, but lifted the siege on the rumor that the Hittites or Egyptians were approaching to help Israel (2 Ki 6:24 to 7:16). About 842 b.c. he was murdered by Hazael, who became his successor and the founder of a new Aramaic dynasty in Damascus (ch 8:15). A stele erected by Ben-hadad, called here Bar Hadad, dedicated to his god Melkarth , was found at Bureij, about 41/2 mi. (c. 7 km.) north of Aleppo in northern Syria. The Bar Hadad of this stele was considered by W. F. Albright to be Ben-hadad I, but further studies have made it more probable that he was the crown prince in the reign of Ben-hadad II (F. M. Cross, BASOR 205 [Feb., 1972], 36–42).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "Where is the prince." Daughter of Ethbaal king of Tyre and Sidon, and wife of Ahab, a first marriage alliance of Israel's king with a pagan. The results are disastrous. As idolater and persecutor, she is a symbol of wickedness (Rev. 2:20)</shortdescription>
    <article>Jezebel. The infamous wife of King Ahab of Israel and daughter of Ethbaal, who was king of Tyre and Sidon (1 Ki 16:31 Jos. Ant. viii. 13. 1) and the priest of Astarte (Jos. Apion i. 18). As a pagan of strong will she made a determined and successful attempt to introduce her religion into Israel. She killed worshipers of Yahweh, persecuted the prophets, and supported hundreds of prophets of Baal for whom Ahab built a temple in Samaria (1 Ki 16:32 18:4, 13, 19). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The prophet Elijah, who had incurred her wrath by his vocal and active opposition to Baal worship, by slaying all the prophets of Baal at Mount Carmel (ch 18:40) excited her wrath even more (ch 19:1–3). Jezebel was responsible for the murder of Naboth, the owner of a vineyard that her husband Ahab desired to possess (1 Ki 21:1–16). Elijah predicted a speedy and gruesome punishment for this crime (vs 17–24), a prophecy that was fulfilled 11 years after Ahab’s death, when Jehu usurped the throne. Arriving at Jezreel after slaying Joram, Jehu saw Jezebel looking out of the window of her palace. He challenged her eunuchs to throw her down, which they did, pushing her through the window. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
She fell in front of Jehu’s chariot, and he drove over her body. A little later he gave orders to bury her, since she was of royal blood, but only her skull, feet, and hands were found the rest of her body had already been eaten by dogs, the scavengers of the East (2 Ki 9:7, 30–37). Because of Jezebel’s seduction of the Israelites to idolatry, her name is used in Rev 2:20 as a symbol of that form of seduction in later periods.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "God is exalted" or "whom God afflicts." She is the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel and wife of Jehoram Joram, king of Judah. She walks in her father's ways. When her husband dies, she resolves to be queen and kills all heirs except Joash.</shortdescription>
    <article>Athaliah, name means "Yahweh is exalted." The wife of King Jehoram of Judah, a daughter of Ahab and granddaughter of Omri (2 Ki 8:18, 26 2 Chr 21:6 22:2), the only reigning queen in OT Hebrew history. She usurped the throne when Jehu of Israel slew her son Ahaziah (841 b.c.). To secure her position she ordered all her son’s offspring killed. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
However, without her knowledge, Joash, an infant son of Ahaziah, escaped the massacre, and was hidden by Jehosheba, the wife of the high priest Jehoiada (2 Ki 11:1, 2 2 Chr 22:10, 11). Having been reared in the idolatrous house of Ahab and Jezebel, Athaliah introduced the worship of Baal into Judah (2 Ki 11:18 2 Chr 23:17). In her 7th regnal year (835 b.c.), in an insurrection against her rule, Athaliah was slain and the child Joash crowned (2 Ki 11:3–16 2 Chr 22:12 23:1–16).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Shalmaneser III was the first Assyrian king to come in contact with Israel. Jehu, king of Israel is mentioned in one of his victory steles.</shortdescription>
    <article>Shalmaneser III (859–834 b.c.), a son of Ashurnasirpal II. He was a great warrior and the first Assyrian king to come in contact with Israel. In his first year he waged an aggressive war in northern Syria, causing several kings of Syria and Palestine to form a league to meet his menace. Twelve kings in all joined the league whom Shalmaneser met in his 6th year (853 b.c.) at Qarqar in central Syria. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The allied armies were led by Ben-hadad of Damascus and the king of Hamath. Ahab of Israel furnished 10,000 foot soldiers and 2,000 chariots, about half of all the chariots of the allied armies. Shalmaneser claims to have won a victory, but the truthfulness of his claim is doubted, because he returned at once to Assyria, and therefore must have been weakened. He returned after 5 years, but was again stopped by the allies, and again during the following campaign. However, he was finally able to break the power of the league in his 14th year (845 b.c.), and in his 18th year (841 b.c.) he defeated King Hazael of Damascus at Mount Hermon. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The kings of Tyre and Sidon, as well as King Jehu of Israel, paid tribute and at once became Assyrian vassals. On the famous Black Obelisk, found in 1845 by Henry Layard at Nimrud, and now in the British Museum, the payment of Jehu’s tribute is depicted in sculpture. On the 2nd of the 5 rows of relief King Jehu is seen kissing the ground at the feet of Shalmaneser and offering him, as tribute, bars and vessels of precious metals, which are carried by Israelite courtiers.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "God is salvation." He is the son of Shabat and successor to Elijah. He asks for a double-portion of the Spirit, and works as a pastor-prophet in north Israel about 50 years, marked by many miracles. He establishes school of the prophets.</shortdescription>
    <article>Elisha, name means "God is salvation." Son of Shaphat, of Abel-meholah the prophet who succeeded Elijah as God’s special envoy to the northern kingdom of Israel. His ministry as pastor-prophet spanned the reigns of Jehoram (Joram), Jehu, Jehoahaz, and Jehoash of the northern kingdom, and thus lasted from at least 852 b.c. to about 798 b.c. a period of more than half a century. On the national scene he completed the eradication of Baal worship begun by Elijah, counseled the king of Israel on national policy, and took an intense personal interest in the problems and needs of the individuals with whom his ministry brought him into contact. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
He supervised the so-named "schools of the prophets" founded 2 centuries. earlier by Samuel, and thus made what was perhaps his greatest single contribution to the spiritual life of the nation. In the presence of need he was ever solicitous and largehearted in the presence of a limited understanding of the divine will he was tolerant and patient in the presence of danger he manifested firm, unflinching courage in the presence of evil he was stern and severe without being vindictive. Whereas Elijah tended to be ascetic in dress and diet, in place of abode, and in his limited contacts with people—at least insofar as the record goes—Elisha lived close to the people he served, and loved social life. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Unlike the life of Elijah, who appeared on the stage of sacred history for a few striking events, Elisha’s life is recorded as a steady ministry during which he constantly ministered to the needs of his fellow men as individuals, as well as to the spiritual life of the nation as a whole. Although for a time there seems to have been an encouraging response on the part of the nation to his leadership as a prophet, the reforms he set in motion were short-lived and did not prevent the complete dissolution of the northern kingdom some 75 years after his death.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>The 5th king of Judah, frequently called Joram.</shortdescription>
    <article>Name means "Yahweh is exalted". The 5th king of Judah, frequently called Joram. Biblical chronological data (1 Ki 22:42 2 Ki 1:17 3:1) indicate that Jehoram was associated with his father Jehoshaphat on the throne for about 5 or 6 years (c. 854–c. 848 b.c.), before he became sole ruler. He ruled for less than 8 years (2 Chr 21:5), c. 848–841 b.c.. He was married to Athaliah, a daughter of Ahab, and followed his wife in Baal worship, as his father-in-law had followed Jezebel (2 Ki 8:18, 26 2 Chr 21:6, 11). After his father’s death, Jehoram murdered all his brothers and other princes of Judah (2 Chr 21:1–4). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
His wickedness did not go unpunished, for one calamity after another befell him, as Elijah in a letter to him had predicted (vs 12–15). First the Edomites revolted, and though Jehoram was able to defeat them, they remained independent (2 Ki 8:20–22 2 Chr 21:8–10). Thus Judah lost the copper mines of Edom and the city of Eziongeber with the city’s port facilities. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Then Libnah revolted (2 Ki 8:22 2 Chr 21:10) and during an invasion of the Philistines and tribesmen from northwestern Arabia Jerusalem was looted, the palace ransacked, and the king’s harem and all his sons, except the youngest, were taken captive (2 Chr 21:16, 17 2 Chr 22:1). Finally an incurable intestinal disease tormented the king during the last two years of his life (ch 21:18, 19). He died unmourned and was buried in Jerusalem but not in the royal tombs (v 20).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Omri strategically moves the capital of Israel to Samaria from Tirzah which is a much better location politically.</shortdescription>
    <article>The accession of Omri marked a new period of settled government and prosperity for the northern kingdom. While the capital was at Tirzah, the nation had gone through a long period of dissension and unrest. Possibly seeds of disaffection still lurked at Tirzah, causing Omri to decide upon a new site for his capital. The hill of Samaria, 7 1/4 mi. (11.6 km.) northwest of Shechem, was the site selected. It would have been difficult to find a more perfect spot for the nation’s capital. Its position was one of great beauty, commanding a view of the sea and of the country for miles around. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It was situated at the heart of the land. Militarily, the hill, with its steep sides, was admirably adapted to defense, as is shown by the long sieges it endured (1 Kings 20:1 2 Kings 6:24 17:5 18:9, 10). The country round about was singularly productive. On the hill were abundant springs of water. Its history vindicated the sagacity of its founder, for Samaria continued as the capital of Israel till the close of the nation’s history. Excavations at the ancient site of Samaria date the lowest levels of the city to Omri’s day.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "held by God." He is the successor of Ahab and is the 9th king of Israel's northern kingdom whose reign lasts 2 years. He does evil in God's sight. He falls through a lattice and inquires of Baal-Zebub when he will die. Elijah intercepts.</shortdescription>
    <article>Ahaziah, name means "Yahweh has grasped (my hand)." The 9th king of Israel, the northern kingdom (if Tibni is included in the count). Ahaziah followed his father Ahab on the throne and reigned less than 2 years (c. 853–852 b.c.). It is unusual that his mother, probably Jezebel, is not mentioned by name. True to the family tradition he "did evil in the sight of the Lord" and served Baal (1 Ki 22:40, 51–53). He joined Jehoshaphat of Judah in building a fleet of ships to be sent out to Ophir for gold. The ships were wrecked at Eziongeber on the Gulf of Aqabah, probably in one of the dangerous storms that come up very suddenly there. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Ahaziah apparently proposed a second attempt, but Jehoshaphat declined after being warned by a prophet against joining the wicked king of Israel (1 Ki 22:48, 49 2 Chr 20:35–37). The rebellion of Moab seems to have occurred during his reign, but nothing was done to force that country back into subjection (2 Ki 1:1). Ahaziah was seriously injured when he "fell down through a lattice" in his palace. When he sent messengers to Baal-zebub, god of Ekron, to request healing, his men were intercepted by Elijah, who sent them back with word that the king would die of his injuries (vs 2–4). Since he died without a son, the throne passed to his brother Jehoram, or Joram (v 17).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Omri conquers the Moabites as is shown by the Moabite Stone of King Mesha. Moab pays tribute to Omri's son Ahab as shown in 2 Kings 3:4.</shortdescription>
    <article>At this time Moab was situated directly east of the lower Jordan and the Dead Sea. The region was fruitful and well watered, and was, in the main, a great grazing country. Even today it is noted for its flocks and its herds. The king of Moab in those ancient times may be compared with a modern Arab sheik, whose wealth is estimated by the size of his flocks and the number of his cattle. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Israelites paid tribute to Moab. The record in 2 Kings 3:4 of Moab’s servitude to Israel in the days of Mesha is corroborated by the Moabite Stone. That record tells of the oppression of Moab for many years by Omri and Ahab and of Mesha’s successful revolt. The payment of tribute in kind was customary in the East at this time. The Assyrians often received tribute in cattle, horses, sheep, and other commodities. Jehoshaphat received as tribute from the Arabians "seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats" (2 Chron. 17:11).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>10th king of the northern kingdom of Israel, sometimes called Jehoram. He was the son of Ahab and Jezebel and followed his elder brother Ahaziah as the last king of the dynasty of Omri.</shortdescription>
    <article>Joram (jo`ram) means “Yahweh is exalted”. Joram was the 10th king of the northern kingdom of Israel (if Tibni is included in the count), sometimes called Jehoram. He was the son of Ahab and Jezebel and followed his elder brother Ahaziah as the last king of the dynasty of Omri. He reigned for twelve years. He was somewhat less idolatrous than his father and removed the pillar of Baal, though Baal worship seems to have continued until the time of Jehu though in a less official form. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Joram was probably the king to whom Ben-hadad II of Damascus sent his commander Naaman to be cured from leprosy (2 Ki 5:1-7), and the unidentified king to whom Elisha revealed the movements of the Syrian army, and who fed the enemy soldiers after they had been smitten with blindness at Dothan (2ki 6:8-23). He was assassinated by Jehu while he was recovering from of a wound he received in a war against the Syrians.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "Jehovah is He." 11th king of Israel northern who reigns 28 years, founder of the longest and strongest northern dynasty, army officer under Ahab and Jehoram. Noted for furious chariot driving, slaying Jezebel, and removing Baal worship.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jehu, name means "Yahweh is He (namely, the God)". The 11th king of Israel (if Tibni is included in the count), who reigned for 28 years (c. 841–c. 814 b.c.) and became the founder of the strongest and longest-reigning dynasty of the northern kingdom. He was the son of Jehoshaphat (not the king of Judah) and grandson of Nimshi. However, he sometimes is called simply the son of Nimshi (1 Ki 19:16 2 Ki 9:2). Jehu was an army officer under Ahab and Jehoram (Joram), and was noted for his furious chariot driving (2 Ki 9:20). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
While engaged in besieging Ramoth-gilead he was anointed king to succeed Ahab by one of Elisha’s young helpers (1 Ki 19:16 2 Ki 9:1–10). Supported by his fellow officers he immediately drove to Jezreel, where King Jehoram (Joram) was recovering from wounds received at Ramoth-gilead. Arriving there he slew the king (2 Ki 9:11–26) and mortally wounded Ahaziah, king of Judah, who was visiting Jehoram (v 27). He also slew Jezebel, the queen mother of Israel (vs 30–37), 70 princes of the house of Ahab (ch 10:1–11), and 42 close relatives of Ahaziah of Judah (2 Ki 10:12–14 2 Chr 22:8 cf. Hos 1:4). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
After Jehu had thus exterminated the house of Ahab, which had originated Baal worship in Israel, he turned against the Baal worshipers in general. He cleverly proclaimed himself an ardent follower of Baal and invited all like-minded men to the Baal temple. When they were all assembled and worshiping, he ordered his soldiers to slay everyone in the Baal temple. The building was then desecrated and made into a latrine (2 Ki 10:18–28). Because Jehu had been zealous in uprooting Baal worship, the Lord promised that his dynasty would continue for 4 more generations (v 30). However, Jehu did not break with the bull worship of Jeroboam, and was thus responsible for the continuation of Israel’s idolatry (vs 29, 31).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
During the year that Jehu came to the throne (841/40 b.c.) King Shalmaneser III of Assyria invaded Syria, and Jehu considered it prudent to meet him as a vassal with tribute rather than as an enemy. This submission of Jehu is recorded on the famous Black Obelisk, which was found by Layard in the ruins of Nimrud (Biblical Calah) and which is now in the British Museum . This obelisk has on it a pictorial representation of Jehu, the only contemporary pictorial representation of any Hebrew king. Shalmaneser III was followed by weak kings, a circumstance that gave Hazael of Damascus a free hand to turn against Israel. Because Jehu was not strong enough to stand up against the Aramaeans, they took from him all Israelite territories east of the Jordan (2 Ki 10:32, 33 cf. Amos 1:3).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "the Lord's servant." Obadiah is like a prime minister for the evil King Ahab. He is a devout follower of God and when Jezebel massacres the prophets, Obadiah hides 100 in two caves and cares for them.</shortdescription>
    <article>The character of Obadiah was in keeping with the meaning of his name (the Lord's servant). It is significant that the king would keep a man in so important an office whom he knew to be a servant of the Lord. But Ahab knew that this man who was faithful to God would also be faithful in administering the affairs of the royal household. Jezebel's treacherous hatred for the Lord and His servants is clearly outlined in 1 Kings 18. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Not until here is the picture given us of the severity of the persecution against God’s people, and who was its leading spirit. Queen Jezebel, enraged over Elijah’s message shutting up the heavens that they might not rain, was determined that the prophet and all who associated themselves with him in the service of Jehovah should be slain. Indeed, quite apart from the famine, Jezebel’s devotion to Baal would make her hostile to the prophets of God.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Obadiah hides 100 prophets from her in a cave. The prophets here mentioned were evidently members of the schools of the prophets. They were a group of prophet scholars and prophet preachers who were originally trained under the prophets and dedicated their lives to a promulgation of the message of righteous and holy living. The fact that 100 of them were hid by Obadiah shows that they must have been quite numerous even in Israel, which for so long a period had been going contrary to the ways of the Lord. Hiding them in a cave was not too difficult. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Caves were common in Palestine. In the Mt. Carmel region alone over 2,000 caves have been counted. Caves in Palestine were both natural and man made, and served as homes, tombs, storehouses, cisterns, or stables for cattle. In times of war and oppression they afforded excellent places of refuge (Joshua 10:16–27 Judges 6:2 1 Sam. 13:6 22:1 24:3–10 2 Sam. 23:13).</article>

    <shortdescription>In the third year of his reign, Jehoshaphat, the 4th king of the southern kingdom of Judah, sends princes, Levites, and priests throughout the land to teach the law of God. God greatly blesses him at this time.</shortdescription>
    <article>King Jehoshaphat sent to the princes in various parts of the land and directed them to arrange for the instruction of the people, presumably by the Levites and priests. They themselves did not do the actual preaching. Moses had given important instruction which, if heeded, would mean much to the nation. Jehoshaphat understood that the prosperity of his nation depended upon obedience to the commands of the Lord. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
He therefore did all that was in his power to see that the people became acquainted with the divine requirements, that they might put away sin and walk fully in the ways of the Lord. The king sent these spiritual leaders throughout all the cities. Jehoshaphat’s measures were not halfhearted. Throughout the country the priests were sent with the commission to instruct the people in the law of the Lord and the ways of righteousness. A spiritual awakening in all parts of the nation was the result of the king’s earnest efforts for his people. He became Judah’s first great reforming king.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>God calls Elijah to speak to King Ahab, a wicked king of Israel, and tell him there will be no rain "except at my word." God then instructs Elijah to go and hide.</shortdescription>
    <article>Here begins a new section of Kings, entirely different in spirit from that which has gone before. Instead of a few cold facts concerning the evil reigns of the kings, we now find a recital of some of the most stirring deeds of the greatest of prophets. The stories are detailed and graphic, full of spiritual beauty and moral instruction. Elijah appears on the scene as a man with an urgent errand for God. The hour is one of crisis. Sin has invaded the land, and if not stopped, will soon engulf all in tragic ruin. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Elijah meets the foe as a valiant warrior for God, bearing witness for Him by word and deed, living the life of a recluse, or standing boldly on the heights of Carmel, calling down fire from heaven, and wielding the sword of vengeance in the slaughter of the prophets of Baal. As the gripping tale unfolds its account of courage, faith, amazing fidelity, kindly affection, or earnest zeal in service for God, it is impossible not to see in the prophet a type of the greater Elias who was yet to come (Matt. 17:10–12). The name Elijah well suited the prophet for his mission. It means "Jehovah is my God."&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The story of Elijah is introduced with dramatic abruptness. There is no introduction, nothing concerning the prophet’s call, nothing concerning the prophet’s call, nothing concerning his early experiences. He is mentioned by name as one of the inhabitants of Gilead, and then he stands before the king delivering his solemn message of judgment to come. In the solitude of the mountains of Gilead the heart of Elijah had been deeply moved as he thought of the ever-increasing tide of apostasy that was flooding the land. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
His soul was distressed and his indignation aroused, and he prayed most earnestly that something might happen to stay the tide of evil—that if necessary, judgments might come to bring the people to their senses and help them to see the folly of trusting in Baal. His prayer was heard, and Elijah was himself sent to the king with his startling message of judgment to come. Baal was worshiped as the source of life and blessing, as the great storm god, who supplied the earth with moisture, and gave to the land its increase. Now Israel was to learn that Baal could not provide these blessings.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "whom God beholds." He is an officer of Ben-Hadad II whom he succeeds according to Elijah. The Assyrians soon attack him with great loss. Three years later they attack again, but he submits to them. He reigns 36 years.</shortdescription>
    <article>Hazael, name means "God has seen." A king of Damascus, and before assuming that office a high royal officer of Ben-hadad II, whom he succeeded on the throne. He was sent to Elisha, who was then in Damascus, to inquire whether the king would recover from an illness. He was told that his master would die, that he would become king of Damascus, and that he would commit great atrocities against the people of Israel. In delivering this message Elisha carried out a divine commission given some time earlier to his master Elijah (2 Ki 8:7–13 1 Ki 19:15). Upon hearing the prophet’s words Hazael returned to the palace, assassinated the king, and ascended the throne (2 Ki 8:14, 15). His reign lasted from c. 842 to c. 805 b.c.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In his wars against Israel, Hazael smote King Joram at Ramoth-gilead (2 Ki 8:28, 29 2 Ki 9:14, 15), took from Jehu all his Transjordan territories (ch 10:32, 33), and fought Jehoahaz (ch 13:3, 22). It was not until after the death of Hazael that Israel freed itself from the heavy yoke of the Aramaeans (vs 24, 25). Judah was also the object of Hazael’s military conquests, and Joash of Judah was able to save Jerusalem from siege and possible capture only by paying a huge tribute when the Aramaeans campaigned against Gath (ch 12:17, 18). The prophet Amos calls Damascus the "house of Hazael" (Amos 1:4).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Hazael fought twice against King Shalmaneser III of Assyria, first in 841 b.c. and again in 838 b.c. Shalmaneser claimed to have inflicted a severe punishment on Damascus (ANET 280). When Damascus was attacked by Adad-nirari III of Assyria, a few years later, Hazael (for some strange reason referred to as Mari in the Assyrian records) paid a heavy tribute to avert full destruction. Among the tribute a "bed (inlaid) with ivory" is mentioned in the Assyrian records (ANET 281, 282). The ivory inlays of that bed, inscribed with Hazael’s name, were found during the excavations of Irslan Tash in northern Syria.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>At the end of a 3 1/2 year drought, Elijah calls Ahab to bring all the prophets of Baal to Mt. Carmel for a showdown. They call to their god to answer by fire but to no avail. God answers Elijah's prayer. He later prays 7 times before rain comes.</shortdescription>
    <article>Ahab told Jezebel how God responded on Mt. Carmel.  It was a wonderful tale of what Elijah had done through the might and power of God. But it had no effect in touching Jezebel’s heart and bringing about a desire to mend her evil ways. A hearing of truth simply hardens where it does not save. She became angry and threatened his life. Here was a man of God who had done a valiant service for his master, and now he was threatened with death for his noble efforts. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It is not in this world that the righteous receive their just awards for service performed in the name of the Lord. One of the apparent tragedies of life is that those who do the most in the cause of righteousness are those who also suffer the most. The reason may not always be understood. But there is comfort in the thought that Jesus, the sinless One, suffered more than any child of humanity will be called upon to suffer. The servant is not greater than his lord.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Elijah ran for his life. After so complete a triumph over the prophets of Baal, and after so great a display of courage, it would seem that God’s prophet would be ready to meet any trial of faith. One might assume that Elijah, having had so marked an evidence of the presence and blessing of God, would never let his courage fail. But he was suffering from the reaction that so frequently follows marked success. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
He had hoped that the glorious victory on Carmel would break the spell of Jezebel upon the king. When the prophet was informed of the queen’s stubborn resistance to the new appeal for reformation, it was more than he could bear. He was unprepared for the cool, calculated, determined hatred of this wicked queen. He could think only of how to escape the clutches of so embittered and relentless a foe. Without thinking of the consequences of his course he fled for his life.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "valley of vision." He is the servant of Elisha who shows compassion to the Shunammite woman, but covetousness with Naaman the Syrian leper's gifts. He receives Naaman's leprosy. He later speaks to King Joram about Elisha's great deeds.</shortdescription>
    <article>Gehazi is Elisha's servant. He appears first in favorable light when he showed sympathy with a childless Shunammite woman (2 Ki 4:14), and when he showed zeal for the honor of the prophet, who he thought was not being shown the proper respect (v 27). Later he is pictured as covetous and lying. To Naaman, the Syrian commander whom Elisha had healed of leprosy, he made it appear that the prophet had broken his word. As punishment the leprosy of Naaman fell on him (ch 5:20–27). His meeting with the king of Israel after a seven-year famine (ch 8:4–6) seems to have occurred before he was punished with perpetual leprosy.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "Yahweh has grasped my hand." He is the youngest son of Jehoram and Athaliah, the 6th king of Judah. He reigns for less than one year. He joins his uncle Joram of Israel to war against Hazael. He flees but is fatally wounded.</shortdescription>
    <article>Ahaziah, name means "Yahweh has grasped (my hand)." The 6th king of the southern kingdom of Judah, who reigned for less than one year (c. 841 b.c.). In 2 Chr 21:17 he is called Jehoahaz, a name in which the two component parts of Ahaziah are simply reversed, leaving the meaning unchanged. "Azariah" in 2 Chr 22:6 should doubtless be read "Ahaziah," in harmony with the LXX, the Syriac, and 15 Hebrew manuscripts. Ahaziah was the youngest son of Jehoram and Athaliah, and followed his father in wickedness. He came to the throne at the age of 22 (2 Ki 8:26 2 Chr 22:1–4). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
He joined his uncle Joram (or Jehoram) of Israel to fight against Hazael of Damascus at Ramoth-gilead. Jehoram was wounded in this battle and retired to Jezreel to recover from his wounds. While he was there Ahaziah paid him a visit (2 Ki 8:28, 29 2 Chr 22:5, 6), and it was during their stay in Jezreel that Jehu revolted. Upon arriving at Jezreel this new aspirant to the throne slew Jehoram. Ahaziah fled but was fatally wounded. His body was taken to Jerusalem for burial (2 Ki 9:27–29 2 Chr 22:7–9). After his death his mother Athaliah slew his heirs (except the infant Joash, who was hidden away) and took the throne (2 Ki 11:1–3).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>King Ahab wants a vineyard near the palace in Jezreel owned by Naboth. Since he will not sell the vineyard to the king and the law forbids legally taking the land unless the owner or heirs are dead, Jezebel wickedly plots Naboth's death.</shortdescription>
    <article>Naboth's vineyard, which was coveted by King Ahab, was in the city of Jezreel in the plain of Esdraelon, to the north of Mt. Gilboa. It was on the brow of a steep, rocky descent sloping down toward the north and east. Since the ancient vineyards seem to have been to the east of the city, Ahab’s palace was probably on the same side (see on ch. 18:45), affording a splendid view all the way toward Jordan. Ahab spoke with Naboth. This account reveals the covetous, petulant, selfish disposition of the king, and the cold, calculating cruelty of the queen.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Naboth was, of course, not ready to lose his vineyard. To Naboth it seemed wrong to part with his property. The Levitical code provided that "the inheritance of the children of Israel" might not "remove from tribe to tribe," but that everyone should "keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe to tribe," but that everyone should "keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers" (Num. 36:7–9). If for any reason property was sold, specific regulations were set forth providing for its periodic return to the families of the original owners (Lev. 25:13–28). Naboth believed it to be against the spiritual purpose of the Levitical law for him to transfer his inheritance to the king.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Ahab had earlier returned home "heavy and displeased" upon learning that his dealings with Ben-hadad were not according to the purpose of God (ch. 20:43). Not being able to secure the vineyard on which he had set his heart, he again went home "heavy and displeased." His attitude was like that of a spoiled, selfish child, interested in no one but himself. When he could not have his own way he became sullen and angry, refused to eat, and threw himself on his bed. His whole kingdom seemed to mean nothing to him as long as he did not possess the vineyard of Naboth. Jezebel’s response was full of bitterness and scorn. Does a man who is lord of the realm need to admit that he cannot secure a small parcel of ground? Is Ahab the king allowing himself to be thwarted by some insignificant subject of his? The item could be easily handled—she would take care of the matter herself and show him how such things are done.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
To Ahab it evidently was a matter of no consequence as to how Jezebel secured the vineyard, so long as it was secured. He did not restrain her from writing letters in his name, stamped with his seal, and so became equally responsible with her for the dastardly deed. The ready acquiescence of the rulers of the city in carrying out this foul plot is characteristic of the worst to be found in Oriental despotism. The word of the king was law. Even base murder would be carried out under the pretense of justice. This ready submission of the elders and nobles implied a deep moral degradation among the people. It appears from 2 Kings 9:26 that not only Naboth but also his sons were stoned. When Achan was put to death his sons and daughters were stoned with him (Joshua 7:24, 25). With Naboth’s sons out of the way there would be no heirs to law claim to the vineyard. The crime thus became doubly heinous. Naboth was dead and his sons with him, and all his property now belonged to the royal domain. Heedless of consequences, Ahab immediately took over the property as his own.</article>

    <shortdescription>The first battle between Israel and Assyria ended in victory to Israel. Ahab had brought 2,000 chariots and 10,000 foot soldiers to the battle. This battle is not mentioned in the Bible.</shortdescription>
    <article>Shalmaneser III (859–834 b.c.), a son of Ashurnasirpal II. He was a great warrior and the first Assyrian king to come in contact with Israel. In his first year he waged an aggressive war in northern Syria, causing several kings of Syria and Palestine to form a league to meet his menace. Twelve kings in all joined the league whom Shalmaneser met in his 6th year (853 b.c.) at Qarqar in central Syria. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The allied armies were led by Ben-hadad of Damascus and the king of Hamath. Ahab of Israel furnished 10,000 foot soldiers and 2,000 chariots, about half of all the chariots of the allied armies. Shalmaneser claims to have won a victory, but the truthfulness of his claim is doubted, because he returned at once to Assyria, and therefore must have been weakened.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Benhadad I from Damascus attacks Samaria. Ahab pushes him back and a year later does so even more severely in the battle of Aphek and captures him. But Ahab foolishly releases him and spares his life.</shortdescription>
    <article>This chapter (1 Kings 20) is quite different in contents and spirit from most of the material in Kings. It gives an interesting and valuable picture of the political life of the times. Benhadad had grown to be a powerful king and now occupied the dominant position among the rulers of western Asia, as is evidenced by the fact that the Assyrian records list him first among the western allies who fought against Shalmaneser III at Qarqar. When Behadad besieges Samaria, he demands Ahab surrender. Amidst threats a prophet of the Lord approaches Ahab and assures him victory through the young men of Israel. Seven thousand gather at noon when at the heat of the day the attackers were probably resting unarmed, with no expectation of being attacked. Benhadad at this time was probably well under the influence of liquor, unable to evaluate the situation or to make wise decisions. Since the sortie was made at noon, the approach was detected and there was not complete surprise. Word was sent to the king that a group of Hebrews was seen approaching. In his haughtiness Benhadad ordered all the Hebrews to be seized, whether they had come out to negotiate terms of peace, whether they were offering to surrender, or whatever their purpose might be. The men attacked. They fought man to man and hand to hand. An alert group of archers or spearmen might have been able to keep the little band of Hebrews at bay, but the Syrians did not awake to the situation till it was too late. Panic seized the host, and they turned and fled.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>When Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, insists that Ahab, king of Israel, bring a true prophet of God to share the outcome of a battle, Micaiah ironically agrees with the false prophets, but then tells the truth. He predicts Ahab's death at Ramoth-gilead.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jehoshaphat was already in alliance with Ahab, this alliance having been formed by the marriage of Ahab’s daughter Athaliah to Jehoshaphat’s son and heir, Jehoram (2 Kings 8:18, 27). Since Ahaziah, the son of this union, was 22 years old at the time of his accession (2 Kings 8:26), the alliance must have been in existence for some time. The fact that the kings succeeding Jehoshaphat in Judah are Jehoram and Ahaziah (2 Kings 8:16, 25), and that Ahab’s two sons who succeeded him on the throne were named Ahaziah and Joram (1 Kings 22:40 2 Kings 1:17 3:1), is a further indication of the friendship existing between the two royal houses at this time.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Judah as well as Israel seems to have had an army equipped with both cavalry and chariots. Jehoshaphat was a strong military leader, feared and respected by the nations about (2 Chron. 17:10–19). Jehoshaphat, with his characteristic piety (1 Kings 22:43 cf. 2 Chron. 17:3–9 19:3–11 20:5–32), suggested to Ahab that inquiry be made of the Lord before the expedition was undertaken, and that the inquiry be made that day. Prophets were called. These were probably not prophets of Baal, inasmuch as it is not likely that Ahab would have insulted Jehoshaphat, who had distinctly asked for a prophet of the Lord (Yahweh), by summoning the avowed prophets of a heathen deity. They claimed to speak in the name of Jehovah, but they were false prophets who predicted God would "deliver". The king of Judah is distinctly dissatisfied with the prophets of Israel, thus indicating that they must be placed in an entirely different category from the prophets of the true God and the only real "Lord," Jehovah. From here on, however, the word Yahweh is used by both the true prophet of Jehovah and the others for the God they worship, as "Lord" (vs. 8, 11, 12, 14–17, 19, 21, 24). Son a prophet of Yahweh is called. There was one man, according to Ahab, of whom it was possible to inquire of Yahweh, but Ahab did not like him. This man was a true prophet of Jehovah. Josephus asserts that it was Micaiah (Antiquities viii. 14. 5) who had prophesied evil of Ahab for the king’s unwise conduct toward Benhadad (ch. 20:35–43). Ahab hated Micaiah. Evil usually hates the good. Micaiah was hated by Ahab because his words were not in line with the desires of Israel’s wicked king, who wanted his own way, and wanted prophets who would prophesy accordingly.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Micaiah appears, in dramatic irony, to take up and mock the utterance of the false prophets. "Yes, ‘go, and prosper’—that is what the prophets have been saying to you—and ‘the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king.’ Just try it and see what will happen" One can hear the contempt and scorn in Micaiah’s voice as he gives again the message the king had heard from "all the prophets," the one message that he wanted to hear. Ahab seems to have sensed at once that the prophet spoke in irony. Ahab was well enough acquainted with God, and with men who falsely claimed to speak in His name, to know that Micaiah did not intend his words to be taken as true.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Micaiah now changes his tone and becomes profoundly serious. He delivers the message that was given him by God. Israel would be scattered upon the hills, and would return to their homes without their king. Ahab by his act of violence toward Micaiah reveals the wicked man that he is. He places in prison the prophet whose counsel, if heeded, would have saved his life. Ahab wants Israel to think he does not believe the prophet and that he is certain that he will safely return. But his subsequent conduct (v. 30) shows that he probably had serious misgivings as to the outcome of the engagement to which he was committing himself. Micaiah accepts the king’s challenge, and he wants all the people to take notice. If Ahab returns in peace, then he will admit that the Lord has not spoken by him and that he is a false prophet. The opposite, of course, also holds true. If the king does not return in peace, then the whole nation may know that the 400 prophets who have spoken so loudly and boldly are nothing but deceivers and that the Lord is not with them. It is a fair test (Deut. 18:22).</article>

    <shortdescription>Ahab desires to gain back Ramoth-gilead and invites his ally, Jehoshaphat of Judah to join him in attacking the Syrians. Micaiah the prophet of Yahweh predicts their doom and failure and death, which comes to pass.</shortdescription>
    <article>It might have been expected that Jehoshaphat, who had asked for a prophet of the Lord (v. 5), would heed the prophet’s message and refuse to go upon the expedition Micaiah had foretold would end in disaster. He had, it is true, rashly committed himself, by a solemn promise (v. 4), to take part in the war, and he was evidently bound to Ahab by a military alliance, yet he could have made it clear to Ahab that he could not go contrary to the will of the Lord. Indeed, by so doing he might have dissuaded Ahab from undertaking the war. By his willingness to accompany Ahab, Jehoshaphat was encouraging Ahab to court disaster. As it was, Jehoshaphat received a severe rebuke from the Lord for having joined in this enterprise (2 Chron. 19:2).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The precaution of Ahab (disguising himself) is characteristic of his temper of half belief and half unbelief. In his heart of hearts he knew Micaiah to be a true prophet, and he had a fear that his prophecy would be fulfilled. But he would do everything he could to avert the fulfillment of the prediction. Life’s greatest victories and its greatest defeats at times hang upon causes that seem small indeed. The Syrian bowman, drawing his bow at a venture, killed a king and won a battle. It is unlikely that the man who fired the arrow knew the result of his shot. Shots of venture are sometimes shots of destiny. But it is good to know that no arrow of fate can strike without the knowledge of Him who is overruling all. The driver could turn the chariot, but he could not turn the hands on the clock of fate. Ahab’s last hour had come, and he knew that the prophecy of Micaiah was true. Ahab made a brave attempt to carry on, allowing himself to be supported in his chariot till the very end. The death of the king at even was the death of Israel’s hopes for victory. Not only did Ahab by his stubbornness bring himself down to an inglorious grave he brought tragedy and defeat to an entire nation.</article>

    <article>When Ahaziah falls and hurts himself, he seeks input from Baal-Zebub on whether he will recover. Elijah intercepts messengers with bad news. Ahaziah sends two companies of men to intimidate Elijah but they are destroyed by fire. Those who turn from the true God to the gods of the heathen, find not life but death. It is God alone who is the author of life, and it is in His power to heal and restore. When Satan, under systems of false religion, promises to heal, it is only to bring individuals under the control of his cruel will, henceforth to rule them with a power it seems impossible to break. When the messengers returned so quickly from their errand, Ahaziah knew that they could not have completed their journey to Ekron, and he wished to know the reason why. The messengers either failed to recognize Elijah or though it best not to tell the king who it was that had sent the warning.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Ahaziah’s sending a delegation to inquire of the god of Ekron was to show open and public contempt for Jehovah. This was an insult to the Majesty of heaven which could not be allowed to go unrebuked. Israel must learn that the gods of the Philistines were powerless to give aid in the hour of extremity, and that Jehovah still sat on His eternal throne. As soon as the message was delivered, Ahaziah may have known that it could have come only from Elijah, for who else would speak with such certainty and courage? The king was well acquainted with the appearance of the prophet, hence asks for a description to establish the identification. Ahaziah hated but feared the prophet. The message of doom did not bring the king to repentance. He knew that he was a dying man, but he was filled with bitterness and anger, and was determined to send for the prophet to avert, if possible, the threatened judgment. A band of 50 armed men was sent to intimidate the prophet.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Ahaziah’s recourse to threat in an effort to persuade Elijah to retract his pronouncement of doom was foolish. It showed that the king cherished the same attitude as had his father. Ahab had held Elijah accountable for the disastrous drought in Israel (1 Kings 18:17). Now Ahaziah, by the same perverted reasoning, held Elijah responsible for the consequences he knew would be sure to follow upon the prophet’s word. Such a highhanded attempt to dictate to the prophet and thus reverse the plans of God could not remain unrebuked. The wrath of God fell upon the company of soldiers. Against the presumption and rebellion of Ahaziah the majesty and the supremacy of God stood revealed. By the sending of a second 50 Ahaziah displayed his perversity and stubbornness. He had received overwhelming evidence of divine displeasure upon his course, but he was determined to stubbornly pursue his ill-directed purposes.</article>

    <shortdescription>In 2 Kings 3:4-27 we read of King Mesha or Meshna of Moab rebelling against Israel and King Jehoram. The existence of this king can be confirmed in the discovery of the Moabite Stone discovered in 1868 which summarizes Mesha's accomplishments.</shortdescription>
    <article>Moabite Stone. A black basalt stele containing 34 lines of a text written in preexilic Hebrew script (also called Phoenician) of the 9th cent. b.c. It is the longest historical inscription of ancient Palestine discovered up to the present time in that country. It is composed in the Moabite language, a language closely related to ancient Hebrew, differing from it only in dialectal details. This monument, now in the Louvre, Paris, was discovered in 1868 by the German missionary F. Klein at Dhibân (Biblical Dibon), east of the Dead Sea, where at that time few Europeans could safely travel. He reported his discovery to the Prussian consul Petermann in Jerusalem, who in turn obtained funds from the Berlin Museum to purchase the monument. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
An agreement was subsequently reached with the people of Dhibân for its purchase. In the meantime, however, Charles Clermont-Ganneau of the French Consulate had heard about the discovery of the stone, and had secured a copy of a few lines of its text, which convinced him of its importance. He therefore also began negotiations with the people across the Jordan to obtain the stone for France. This unfortunate competition between the two Western powers aroused the suspicion of the people of Dhibân. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Suspecting that the stone either contained gold or had magical value, they drove the price up, and when Petermann, unhappily, took steps with the Turkish military authorities to force the possessors to surrender the monument according to the agreement, the people of Dhibân decided to destroy it. After first heating it red-hot in a fire they poured cold water on it and thus broke it into many pieces. The pieces were divided among the population and used as charms. Clermont-Ganneau had his agents purchase as many pieces as they could secure. He eventually succeeded in recovering about 2/3 of the monument, and restored it with the help of a rather poor paper squeeze of the inscription made for him by a native before the stone was broken up.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This monument, which can be dated by its historical contents, comes from the 2nd half of the 9th cent. b.c., and is thus of great importance for a study of the Hebrew script and alphabet. It also throws much light on the grammatical and lexical characteristics of the Hebrew language used at that time. Many of its passages and expressions are close parallels to Biblical passages, and it contains the first known non-Biblical text that mentions the name *Yahweh (Jehovah) in the same spelling as in the Hebrew Bible (line 18). It also mentions King Omri of Israel, King Mesha of Moab, and the tribe of Gad, besides numerous Transjordan cities known also from the Bible.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The inscription refers to the subjugation of Moab by Omri, and King Mesha’s rebellion against Israel’s rule at a later time. It deals most certainly with the events mentioned in 2 Ki 1:1 3:4, 5. Mesha’s capture of the cities of Medeba, Nebo, and Jahaz from Israel, and his occupation of Ataroth, formerly inhabited by Gad, probably took place after the unsuccessful campaign of Jehoram and Jehoshaphat against Moab described in ch 3:5–27. Some scholars, however, think that Mesha’s hostile actions against these cities preceded the military campaign of Israel and Judah. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Certainty concerning the sequence is difficult to arrive at, because the Bible does not mention the events described in the Moabite Stone, and Mesha is silent about the campaign of Jehoram and Jehoshaphat. Mesha’s silence in this respect is understandable since this campaign had devastated his country and had cost the life of his eldest son, whom he had sacrificed on the wall of Kir-hareseth (el–Kerak) in order to gain the help of his god Chemosh in a desperate situation. It is of interest to read in lines 14–18 that Mesha had carried away as spoil of war from Nebo some objects of Yahweh, probably cult objects from a high place on which the Israelites, in opposition to God’s will, worshiped God in a pagan fashion. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Such a high place seems to have been located on top of Mount Nebo, which was hallowed by the memory of Moses’ death (Deut 34:1–5). In true barbaric fashion Mesha dragged the cult vessels of Yahweh before his own god Chemosh, and thus intended to humiliate the God of Israel, whose power the Moabites held to be inferior to that of their own god.</article>

    <shortdescription>After Elijah's ascension, Elisha goes to build up the schools of the prophets and is mocked by youth or young men when passing through Bethel. This mockery is not passed by lightly. God's judgment comes upon the youth through bears, and 42 die.</shortdescription>
    <article>Elisha was a prophet of peace with a message of peace. His work was to bring life and gladness to the people of Israel. As he was entering upon this important mission, a number of youth came out of the city of Bethel to make sport of him and to deride his work as a messenger of God. The youth mocked him saying, "Go up thou bald head." The ascension of Elijah had been a most solemn event. God had taken His faithful servant to Himself without permitting him to taste of death. The youth at Bethel had heard of Elijah’s translation, and they made this sacred occasion the subject of taunts and jeers. Elijah was gone, and now they set upon Elisha, derisively calling upon him also to make his ascent and depart from their midst. The young men were inspired by Satan, who was seeking to do what he could to counteract the effect of the solemn event that had occurred and that could not but leave a deep impression upon the people of the land. As Elisha was entering upon his work, Satan was seeking to defeat the plans and purposes of God. If the mockery of these young men had been permitted to pass unnoticed, the work that God intended to do through Elisha would have been greatly retarded, and a victory would have been won for the cause of evil. The occasion called for quick and decisive action.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Elisha was by nature a man of kindness. But there are limits even to kindness in the work of the Lord. The honor of God’s name must be upheld, and His solemn deeds must not be made the subject of jest and mockery by the impious rabble. A prophet of God must be held in respect and his authority must be maintained. Firmness, decision, and resolute action are marks of leadership in those whom God calls to carry responsibilities for Him. This was no time for weakness or indecision. Turning upon the crowd of rude, dissolute youth, Elisha, under the inspiration of Heaven, pronounced upon them the curse of God. The judgment that followed came from God. The severity of the punishment was in keeping with the seriousness of the issues at stake. A signal example was greatly needed to check the growth of irreligion and to show the people how awful a thing it is to make sport of the works of God or to hold in contempt the appointed ministers of Heaven. Holy men of God should be treated with reverence and respect, for they are called to work and to speak in the name of the Lord. They are here as representatives of God, and in showing dishonor to them, men show dishonor to God. The Lord holds men accountable for the treatment they accord His chosen ministers. The terrible judgment that befell the taunting youth of Bethel shows how awful it is to scorn holiness or to show disrespect for a messenger of God.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "Yahweh has grasped my hand." He is the son and successor of Jehu, king of Israel for 17 years. He follows the evil ways of Jeroboam but cries out to God when the Syrians oppress them and they are eventually driven back by his son Jehoash.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jehoahaz, name means "Yahweh has grasped (my hand)." The 12th king of Israel (if Tibni is included in the count), son and successor of Jehu. He ruled 17 years (c. 814–c. 798 b.c.). The weakened kingdom which he inherited from his father suffered numerous disasters as penalty for his own apostasy (2 Ki 13:1–3). Two kings of Damascus, first Hazael and later Ben-hadad III, oppressed Israel, reducing its defenses to 50 horsemen, 10 chariots, and 10,000 foot soldiers (vs 3, 7). If we remember that Ahab was able to muster 2,000 chariots less than 50 years earlier, the extent of the military decline of the kingdom is clearly evident. In desperation Jehoahaz turned to the Lord, and as a result of a partial conversion received some unexpected relief through a "saviour" (vs 4, 5), by which the Assyrian king Adadnirari III (c. 810–782 b.c.) is probably indicated. Adadnirari invaded Syria in 806 and forced the king of Damascus to pay tribute, impoverishing the kingdom to such an extent that for some time the kings of Damascus were unable to molest Israel. Some see evidence of this identification of the "saviour" in the fact that the second part of the name the Adadnirari, which is derived from the Akkadian verb narâru, "to help," means "helper," a word closely related to "saviour." Jehoahaz was buried in Samaria and was succeeded on the throne by his son Jehoash, or Joash (v 9).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <article>A woman's husband dies. He is one of the "sons of the prophets." She has debts and may lose her two sons. She asks Elisha for help and she miraculously receives oil to pay her debts. When he asked, "What shall I do?", the question revealed the kindly spirit of the prophet. Elisha was a man who was interested in the people, always friendly, always sympathetic, and always ready to help. When called upon by the king, he was ready to supply the wants of the whole army, when called on by a poor and friendless widow, he did not turn her away. He asked, "What do you have?" God uses what we have. He is not limited in His resources or His powers, and could easily have supplied the woman’s need without her pot of oil. But He took what she had and placed His blessing upon it. The pot of oil was not much, but in God’s hand and with His blessing it was sufficient to supply all her needs. The pot of oil was the sign of the widow’s utmost poverty, but it was also the means employed by the Lord for the supplying of all her needs.</article>

    <shortdescription>Elisha is teaching the sons of the prophets at Gilgal. When a stew is made, someone accidentally gathers a poisonous plant. When the men complain "there is death in the pot," Elisha throws in some flour and the stew is made good.</shortdescription>
    <article>Elijah had done much in building up the work of the Lord by the interest he displayed in these important centers of training where young men could receive a preparation for a life of ministry to their fellow men. Elisha continued his interest in these schools. Often he visited them to give necessary encouragement and counsel. He once visited Gilgal during a famine. Elijah came to visit and was sitting and talking with the sons of the prophets. The occasion was probably one of spiritual instruction. As Mary sat at the feet of Jesus, so these young men sat before Elisha and learned from him lessons of God. These would be regarded as precious hours, and the Holy Spirit would be present, bringing to the minds of the youth lessons of faith and confidence in God. They learned to appreciate the things of the Spirit more than their daily food.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
At some point Elisha instructed a pot be readied for food. Spiritual food is important, but the body also needs to be fed. Elisha was probably touched as he saw in the lean forms of the students the effects of the famine that was wasting the land. Interested in their spiritual welfare, he also took an interest in their temporal needs. Orders were given that the great pot should be set, so that all might be fed. The schools of the prophets were probably all situated in rural communities, where the students would have the opportunity to raise their own food and to receive a training in agricultural pursuits. Because of the scarcity of food, the students in the prophetic schools were evidently forced to go out in the fields to forage. One man found a wild vine with a gourd. The exact type of plant here mentioned has not been positively identified. Some have taken it to refer to a kind of wild cucumber or gourd, having the form of an egg and possessing a bitter taste. When eaten it causes pain and violent purging. The young men may have taken these wild cucumbers for ordinary ones, which were highly prized as food (Num. 11:5). The fact that a man is a prophet does not give him all knowledge, nor excuse him from exercising every care and precaution. This young man, not knowing the nature of the herbs before him, gathered poison and endangered the lives of all who partook of the fruits of his labors.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
While the stew was cooking, someone exclaimed, "There is death in the pot!" Probably the bitter taste immediately revealed the fact that the food was poisonous. It may have been mixed in the pot with other herbs that were perfectly wholesome, but the gourds spread their poison through the entire pot. Sin is the poison of death. Its influence spreads. Elisha asks for some meal. Whether the meal was a natural antidote for the poisonous herbs is not revealed. It may have had the same significance as had the salt that was thrown into the defiled waters of Jericho (ch. 2:20–22) The meal was wholesome, a source of life and health to those who partook of it. In the hand of the prophet it became a symbol of life which counteracted the evil effects of the seeds of death. Here is a spiritual lesson. The gospel of Christ is the bread of life to those under the condemnation of death. No matter how long or how much the sinner has partaken of the evil fruit of death, there is power in the gospel to heal and restore. All the evil that sin has wrought the Holy Spirit has power to undo. God has the antidote to every form of evil. Christ is the source of life eternal for every man who has the will to live (John 6:27, 33, 35).</article>

    <shortdescription>The kindness of a Shunammite woman and her husband is returned to them when Elisha is treated with hospitality. He asks what he can do for them and then promises them a son. This son later dies but is raised to life.</shortdescription>
    <article>Shunem is a town in the Valley of Jezreel, about 5 mi. (8 km.) north-northwest of Mt. Gilboa, and perhaps 16 mi. (25.6 km.) or more from Mt. Carmel, where Elisha at this time seems to have made his home (v. 25). In his journeys to and fro through the kingdom, Elisha frequently passed through this village, now Sôlem. A woman of high rank often urged Elisha to stay at she and her husband's home. To Elisha was extended the hospitality of this comfortable home. Men of God have the same needs of food and shelter as their fellows, and they appreciate the blessings of Christian fellowship and friendship. Life for a faithful servant of God is often made happy and pleasant by kindly courtesies extended to him by those whom he is here to serve.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In time she decided to build a room on their house for the prophet to stay in. Riches often make the possessor self-centered and forgetful of the needs and desires of others. But this was evidently not the case with this noble woman of Shunem. She was a great woman, but she did not lose the common touch. She lived not for herself alone but strove to make others happy. Having her own needs well provided for, she shared her possessions with others. She had her own household cares and responsibilities, but she did not allow the duties of her home to make her forgetful of the needs and comforts of Elisha and perhaps many others. On his journeys Elisha often looked forward to the pleasant hours of rest and relaxation that would be his when he arrived at the village of Shunem. Kindly hospitality helps to bring among the children of earth a little of the peace and friendship of heaven.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Shunammite had been kind to Elisha and he would be kind to her. But what could he do to repay her for the favors she had bestowed on him? She did not need material things. But Elisha wanted to give her some token of his appreciation. A noble heart does not like to receive a favor and make no return. So he asked her what he could do for her. The question was a test question, for it would reveal exactly what was in the woman’s heart. Had she received the prophet in the name of a prophet, or did she have a secret desire for some reward? He noticed she did not have a child and predicted that next year at this time she would have a son.</article>

    <shortdescription>A gift of bread is brought to Elisha who instructs his servant to feed 100 men. The servant balks, so Elisha repeats the instruction and the men are fed, with leftovers. The story reflects Jesus' feeding of a multitude with bread in Matt. 14:14-21.</shortdescription>
    <article>According to the law of Moses, all first fruits of the harvest were to be offered to God, and were to be given to the priests (Num. 18:12, 13 Deut. 18:4). In this instance a certain faithful worshipper of Jehovah brought his first fruits to Elisha, "the man of God." The Levitical priests had long before this withdrawn from the northern kingdom (2 Chron. 11:13, 14), and some of the pious in Israel probably recognized in the prophets the representatives of Jehovah to whom they might bring the offerings required by the law to be given to the priests. Elisha instructed that this food be given to the people. It was a time of need, even with the prophet and those with him. The people were hungry and in need of food. Elisha could have thought of himself and of his own interests, but instead he thought of those of the people. So Jesus, when with His disciples in a desert place, "saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them" (Matt. 14:14). When evening came, the disciples wished to send them away, that they might find food for themselves, but the words of Jesus were, "They need not depart give ye them to eat" (Matt. 14:16). God still speaks to His children today as they took God still speaks to His Children today as they look upon the weary and needy multitudes of earth, "Give the people, that they may eat."&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The servant looked upon the first fruits with the eyes of man, but Elisha looked upon that same gift of food with the eyes of faith and of God. To the servitor the command of the prophet seemed almost foolish and impossible of accomplishment. What would 20 small barley cakes and a bit of grain do to satisfy the hunger of 100 men? Elisha spoke by inspiration. A prophet speaking in the name of the Lord always speaks the words of God. There is infinite power with God. His resources can supply the needs of all. The touch of His hand can cause the most meager supply to increase. It was the power of God that caused those few loaves to increase till all present had had enough to satisfy their needs. The unknown farmer brought his gift of first fruits to Elisha as an offering to God. The Lord accepted that gift and placed His blessing upon it.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Heaven is closer to earth than many believe. God is always interested in His needy children of earth, and He stands ready at all times to supply their wants. There is no land or people on earth where the power of God is not constantly in operation supplying the wants of those in need. Every producing garden and field bears witness to the miracle-working power of God and His boundless love. God is always at work, looking after the interests of the frail children of earth. The manifestations of His love and power may not be seen today in so marked a manner as they were in the days of Elisha, but if our eyes only could be opened, we would recognize much more clearly and much more often than we do that God still is present and that He still is dealing in love and mercy with the needy children of earth. God’s faithful children may still bring their gifts to the Lord, and with His power and blessing, their meager supplies may be multiplied manyfold to supply the temporal and spiritual needs of the multitudes of earth. What the world needs today is much more of the faith and spiritual insight, the courage and compassion, the strength and spirit, of the prophet Elisha.</article>

    <shortdescription>While cutting trees for wood for a school for the sons of the prophets, a borrowed iron ax head falls into the Jordan. Elisha is asked for help. He cuts a stick and throws it into the water and the ax head floats and is retrieved.</shortdescription>
    <article>The sons of the prophets were students at one of the schools of the prophets, probably the one at Jericho, for they went to the Jordan to secure timber (v. 2). When they explained to Elisha that the school had grown and could no longer accommodate the students, someone suggested they enlarge the school.  These young men were not afraid of work. One of the objectives of the schools of the prophets was to give the students a practical training for life. The young men were trained to work like the people about them, for the they were not to hold themselves aloof from those it was their responsibility to serve. Training the hand was in perfect accord with training the mind and the heart.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Elisha agreed with the plan. The fact that permission was asked of Elisha and that it was he who gave the orders to proceed with the project shows that the prophet was a man of authority, having under his charge the direction of the various schools. They had first asked for permission to go and do the work themselves, and now the invitation was extended to Elisha to accompany them. He agreed to go. Elisha was a man of the people. He was equally at home with kings and generals and with the workers at their daily toil. Never did the he hold himself aloof. Wherever there was the opportunity to serve, wherever his presence was welcome, there he desired to be. The greater the leader, the greater the willingness to serve.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
One student borrowed an axe for the work. The Jews used iron for axheads at a very early date. An axhead in those days was no more secure than it is in modern times, for the legislation of Moses deals with cases in which an axhead slips from the wood while a man is felling a tree (Deut. 19:5). When the borrowed axe head came off the handle and landed in the river, the student exclaimed, "It was borrowed!" Elisha asked where it fell in and then cut a stick and threw it in the water. The axe head floated and was retrieved.</article>

    <shortdescription>Ben-hadad II of Syria besieges Samaria and creates a famine in the city so that extreme hunger leads to extreme incidents. Joram blames Elisha for the famine and wants his head. Elisha predicts all will change in a day and God will deliver them.</shortdescription>
    <article>Benhadad II besieged Samaria. The first Benhadad was a contemporary of Asa (1 Kings 15:18–20). Benhadad II is the same king whom Ahab had twice defeated, and to whom he had shown such unseasonable lenity that he had received a prophetic rebuke (1 Kings 20:1–42). This attack on Samaria was not a minor border raid but serious war of the utmost intensity. Benhadad probably took advantage of a time when Shalmaneser was not engaged in active campaigns in the Mediterranean area. It was a time of famine which were not uncommon in Israel. At the time of Elijah there was a drought that lasted for three and a half years (1 Kings 17:1 to 8:1 Luke 4:25 James 5:17), and in the days of Elisha there was a famine for seven years (2 Kings 8:1). The present famine, however, was the result of the siege.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When things became extreme inside the city, King Joram blamed Elisha for the situation. Elisha had called upon the people to repent and doubtless had made it clear to them that if they did not put away their sins and turn to the Lord with all their hearts, they might expect trouble and distress. The king was bitter against the prophet and now sought to place the blame on him for the continuance of the siege and famine. In doing so he followed the same course as had his brother Ahaziah, and his father Ahab. A man who was truly penitent would have worn sackcloth openly rather than in secret, and he would not have turned upon God’s prophet. Beheading was not an ordinary form of punishment among the Jews, but was common in Assyria and other neighboring nations. With his heart filled with bitterness and wrath, Joram now threatened Elisha with this horrible form of capital punishment.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Joram sought to take the life of Elisha, and sent a man with orders to behead the prophet. But before his arrival, the Lord forewarned Elisha of the king’s intentions, so that the matter could be clearly set before the leaders of the land. Ahab, the father of Joram, was guilty not only of the blood of Naboth but also of the prophets who were slain by Jezebel with his full consent. Even his faithful servant Obadiah feared that he would be put to death by Ahab when told to go to him with a message concerning Elijah (1 Kings 18:9). Joram, the son of a murderer, possessed the same evil traits as his father. The executioner was already on his way, but Elisha showed no concern. He was a prophet of the Lord and knew that his life was in the hands of God and not at the mercy of evil men. Following close upon the heels of the would-be executioner came the king, to see whether or not his orders had been carried out. Elisha is spared and declares that in one day everything will be turned around, which is what happened. Samaria was freed.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "Yahweh has given." The son of Ahaziah, who is slain while Joash (or Jehoash) is a child. His grandmother takes the crown and slays all heirs except Joash who is hidden away and then crowned at about 7. He helps his uncle restore worship.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jehoash (or Joash), name means "Yahweh has given." The 8th ruler of the southern kingdom of Judah, more often called Joash. He reigned 40 years (c. 835–c. 796 b.c.). In 841 b.c., when he was but an infant, his father, Ahaziah, was slain by King Jehu of Israel. Thereupon Athaliah, Ahaziah’s mother, took the throne after slaying all of Ahaziah’s children but one infant son. This child was saved only because his father’s sister Jehosheba, wife of the high priest Jehoiada, spirited him away and kept him in hiding (2 Ki 11:1–3 2 Chr 22:10–12). In the 7th year of Athaliah’s reign Jehoiada presented the young prince to the army officers and gained their support in his plan to overthrow Athaliah and make Joash king. Under the protection of the army the plan was put into effect and the boy was proclaimed king in the Temple. Athaliah, attracted by the acclamations, made her way to the Temple but was slain en route (2 Ki 11:4–16 2 Chr 23:1–15). Jehoiada at once set out to restore the worship of God and to destroy the Baal temple. When the young king grew to manhood, he repaired the Temple, which was now nearly 150 years old, but he allowed the high places to continue and to be used as places of worship (2 Ki 11:17 to 12:16 2 Chr 23:16 to 24:16). However, after Jehoiada’s death, the king changed considerably and became a worshiper of Asherah and other idols. When rebuked for this by his benefactor’s son, Zechariah, he ordered him stoned (2 Chr 24:17–22 cf. Lk 11:51). He also suffered a serious military defeat when Hazael of Damascus invaded Judah after taking the Philistine city of Gath. He could buy himself and Jerusalem off only by handing over to the Aramaeans all the treasures of the palace and of the Temple (2 Ki 12:17, 18 2 Chr 24:23, 24). Soon after this defeat he was assassinated in bed by 2 of his own courtiers (2 Ki 12:20, 21 2 Chr 24:25, 26). He was buried in the City of David, but not in the royal tombs. His son Amaziah followed him on the throne.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription> The king of Assyria is finally able to defeat the coalition of kings that included Syria and Israel. Assyria becomes the new predominant power in the region and Israel is forced to pay tribute to them.</shortdescription>
    <article>Shalmaneser III 859–834 b.c., a son of Ashurnasirpal II. He was a great warrior and the first Assyrian king to come in contact with Israel. In his first year he waged an aggressive war in northern Syria, causing several kings of Syria and Palestine to form a league to meet his menace. Twelve kings in all joined the league whom Shalmaneser met in his 6th year 853 b.c. at Qarqar in central Syria. The allied armies were led by Ben-hadad of Damascus and the king of Hamath. Ahab of Israel furnished 10,000 foot soldiers and 2,000 chariots, about half of all the chariots of the allied armies. Shalmaneser claims to have won a victory, but the truthfulness of his claim is doubted, because he returned at once to Assyria, and therefore must have been weakened. He returned after 5 years, but was again stopped by the allies, and again during the following campaign. However, he was finally able to break the power of the league in his 14th year 845 b.c., and in his 18th year 841 b.c. he defeated King Hazael of Damascus at Mount Hermon. The kings of Tyre and Sidon, as well as King Jehu of Israel, paid tribute and at once became Assyrian vassals. On the famous Black Obelisk, found in 1845 by Henry Layard at Nimrud, and now in the British Museum, the payment of Jehu’s tribute is depicted in sculpture. On the 2d of the 5 rows of relief King Jehu is seen kissing the ground at the feet of Shalmaneser and offering him, as tribute, bars and vessels of precious metals, which are carried by Israelite courtiers.</article>

    <shortdescription>A seven year famine is coming to Israel and Elisha warns the Shunammite woman to flee. She goes to Philistine and when she returns she requests of the king that her property be returned. Gehazi, Elisha's servant, assists in the process.</shortdescription>
    <article>This incident took place some time after that recorded in ch. 4:8–37, but how long after we do not know. At the time of the restoration of the son the husband was still alive. But now there are indications that she may have become a widow. At least her husband is not mentioned, and the instructions given to leave her once prosperous home seem to be directed to one who was without the guiding help of a husband. Elisha took a kindly interest in the people whom he was called to serve. He tried to be a friend to all. Wherever he could do something to make the lot of someone lighter and better, there he was ready to help. There were hard times ahead, and the woman was counseled to depart for a time to sojourn in some place where the situation would be easier than at her home at Shunem. He warned her of a seven year famine. This famine took place sometime during the reign of Joram of Israel, but exactly when, it is impossible to say. The woman of Shunem had learned that there are blessings in the path of obedience. The instruction given was by the direction of God, and although difficulties and hardships still lay ahead, the results would have been far worse if she had refused to obey those instructions.</article>

    <shortdescription>Naaman, a Syrian leper, seeks healing from "the prophet in Israel" when a captive maiden tells his wife about Elisha. He travels with gifts and is healed after washing in the Jordan. Gehazi, Elisha's servant, greedily seeks the gifts &amp; gets leprosy.</shortdescription>
    <article>Syria was often at war with Israel, but this was evidently a period of peace. Only a short time before, Ahab had been slain in battle against Benhadad (1 Kings 22:34–37). The name of the king of Israel is not given, but the events are believed to have taken place in the reign of Joram, Ahab’s son. The narrative reveals the changing fortunes of the nations, and gives an interesting picture of the international relationships and customs of the times. Naaman was an important personage in Syria. He had gained honor and fame by the victories he had helped Syria achieve, but he had the misfortune of being a leper. However, he retained his position as commander of the Syrian hosts, although he must have been seriously handicapped by the terrible disease with which he was afflicted.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In the frequent border raids, a captive girl was taken and waited on Naaman's wife. The captive maid was living the life of a slave, forced to serve in the home of the commander of the armies that had laid Israel low. But she must have been faithful in her service, for otherwise she would not have been employed in the home of an important official. She noticed Naaman's leprosy and spoke to her Naaman's wife. Although a captive, the maid did not forget her homeland or her God. Nor did she think thoughts of ill toward those who had taken her captive and forced her into an involuntary servitude. Filled with love toward her God, her heart went out in sympathy to her ailing master and his wife. Instead of wishing Naaman ill because of the misfortunes that had been brought upon her, she wished him well and hoped for his recovery from his terrible disease. Remembering the marvelous works of Elisha in her homeland, she had faith that the prophet could heal Naaman of his leprosy. What God had wrought through His servant in Israel, she believed He could also perform toward those of an alien race.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
That is, Naaman went to his lord the king of Syria and related to him the words of the captive maid. Little did the girl understand the import of her words of faith in God. Naaman believed because the girl believed, and he carried her testimony before Syria’s king. Thus was Benhadad to learn that Israel’s God was a God of power and a God of love. He had defeated the armies of Israel in battle, and he might have been led to believe that the gods of Syria were mightier than Jehovah. But he was to learn that the God of Israel could do that which was beyond the power of men and beyond the power of the Syrian gods. The greatest testimony that can be borne in behalf of the God of heaven is the testimony of a person whose life reflects implicit confidence in Him. The young maiden's testimony led Naaman to seek Elisha in Israel and he was healed.</article>

    <article>Jehoash means “Yahweh has given”. The 13th king of the northern kingdom of Israel (if Tibni is included in the count). Jehoash, frequently called Joash succeeded his father Jehoahaz as the third king of the dynasty of Jehu, and ruled 16 years. He retained the national worship of Jeroboam’s calves, but was an admirer of Elisha, from whom he received the promise that would defeat the Arameans. He defeated Ben-hadad III three times and recovered the Israelite territories in Transjordan which his father had lost to Hazael. Later in his reign he was challenged to war by the king of Judah whom he defeated. He looted Jerusalem and tore down 400 cubits of the city’s wall before retreating.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "dove." He is the son of Amittai, a prophet in Israel, northern kingdom, during the reign of Jeroboam II. God calls him to prophesy to Nineveh, a foreign city. He runs away but after being swallowed by a whale he ends up in Nineveh.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jonah, name means "dove". A prophet of the northern kingdom of Israel whose ministry came probably before or during the early part of the reign of Jeroboam II (c. 793–c. 753 b.c., nearly 11/2 cent. after the death of Solomon and the division of the kingdom c. 931 b.c. He was the son of Amittai (Jon 1:1), and his home was Gath-hepher in Galilee (2 Ki 14:25). Aside from the information given in the book of Jonah, the only fact known about him is that at some time during the reign of Jeroboam, or earlier, he predicted the restoration of the northern border of Israel (v 25). Somewhat in the manner of Elijah the Tishbite, Jonah appears suddenly on the scene when God sends him to Nineveh (Jon 1:2). Having no desire to go as a prophet to a foreign city such as Nineveh, and being unconcerned about the conversion of its inhabitants, Jonah sets out in the opposite direction, for Tarshish, probably the classical Tartessus on the southern coast of Spain (v 3). As the ship sails most probably northward within sight of the coast, it encounters a violent storm, which its master attributes to the anger of the gods against someone on board. By the casting of lots Jonah is revealed as the guilty person (Jon 1:7–11). With remarkable physical courage he proposes that he be cast overboard, in order that the storm may abate and the ship be saved (v 12). This demonstration of physical courage stands in sharp contrast with Jonah’s moral cowardice in attempting to run away from God. Although Jonah is cast overboard, his life is spared by "a great fish" (v 17), in whose belly he spends the next "three days and three nights"—one 24-hour period, together with unspecified portions of the day preceding and the day following. Jonah’s prayer of repentance is honored, and the fish deposits him "upon the dry land" (ch 2:1, 10). He may now have found himself opposite the island of Cyprus, as much as 150 mi. (c. 240 km.) nearer to Nineveh than when he had boarded the ship. God once more commissions him to go to Nineveh, and he responds without further question (ch 3:1–3). The Ninevites repent and God spares the city (vs 5–10). Despite the mercy shown him, Jonah resents God’s mercy extended to the people of Nineveh (ch 4:1, 2), and is "very angry." But by an object lesson God shows Jonah the folly of his attitude and justifies the decision to spare the people of Nineveh (vs 4–11).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "strengthened by Jehovah." The son of Joash, the 9th king of Judah, southern kingdom, who reigns for 29 years. He is faithful to God early in his reign but turns away from God after the victory over Edom. He is murdered in Lachish.</shortdescription>
    <article>Amaziah, name means "Yahweh is strong." The 9th king of Judah, the southern kingdom, who reigned for 29 years (c. 796–c. 767 b.c.). He succeeded his father Joash, who had been slain for the murder of the priest Zechariah. When Amaziah felt himself securely established on the throne he put his father’s murderers to death but spared their children in harmony with the principles laid down by Moses in the Law (2 Ki 14:1–6 2 Chr 24:23–26 2 Chr 25:1–4 cf. Deut 24:16). He planned a military campaign against Edom, and to assist him hired 100,000 troops from Israel, but on the advice of a man of God he dismissed them. Bitterly disappointed, these rejected men plundered the cities of Judah north of Bethhoron on their way home. Amaziah meanwhile attacked the Edomites and defeated them thoroughly in the Valley of Salt. He also took *Sela, their capital. In view of the supposedly impregnable position of Sela this victory was a major military feat (2 Ki 14:7 2 Chr 25:5–12). Although Amaziah had been faithful to God in his early reign (2 Ki 14:3 2 Chr 25:2), after his victory over Edom he began to worship Edomite gods that he had brought back to Jerusalem. As a prophet had forewarned (2 Chr 25:14–16), this act of idolatry caused his downfall. Following certain advice, he challenged Jehoash (Joash) of Israel to battle, but was badly defeated at Beth-shemesh. Jehoash thereupon took Amaziah to Jerusalem, despoiled his treasures, took hostages, and broke down a portion of the defenses of the capital city of Judah (2 Ki 14:8–14 2 Chr 25:17–24). Later a conspiracy was formed against Amaziah. He fled to Lachish, but was murdered there. He was buried at Jerusalem in a royal tomb (2 Ki 14:19, 20 2 Chr 25:27, 28).</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "may the people multiply." He is the son of Joash, the 14th king of Israel and referred to as Jeroboam II to distinguish him from Jeroboam I. He is one of the strongest kings of Israel and rules for 41 years. Amos and Hosea live then.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jeroboam II. The 14th king of Israel (if Tibni is included in the count), son of Joash (or Jehoash), sometimes called Jeroboam II to distinguish him from Jeroboam, 1. His reign lasted 41 years (c. 793–c. 753 b.c., including an 11-year coregency with his father c. 793–c. 782 b.c., as seems to be indicated from chronological synchronisms. see Chronology, V, 2). Either prior to the reign of Jeroboam or during the early years of his rule, the prophet *Jonah predicted that the new king would recover the territories in the north and east that in former times had belonged to Israel (2 Ki 14:25). Jeroboam fulfilled this prophecy. He became the strongest king of the dynasty of Jehu, if not of all the kings who occupied the throne of the northern kingdom. The Biblical record about his reign is extremely brief, consisting of only 7 verses (vs 23–29), yet the brief account of his military successes shows clearly that no ruler of the northern kingdom either before or after him could point to greater achievements than Jeroboam II. He conquered Damascus and Hamath on the Orontes, and recovered most of the territory of Syria and Transjordan down to the Dead Sea, so that his territory included all that David and Solomon had held, with the exception of Judah. It was fortunate for him that Assyria was experiencing a period of weakness during his reign, and could therefore not interfere with his expansionist activities.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
While the kingdom of Israel enjoyed political prestige and economic prosperity, the moral and religious state was extremely low. The gloomy picture painted by the prophets Amos and Hosea of the conditions prevailing under Jeroboam shows that in spite of extravagant sacrifices and the celebration of religious feasts, the country was morally corrupt (Amos 5:21, 22 2:6–8 Hos 6:6–10). Only 6 months after Jeroboam’s death his dynasty met its end by the assassination of his son Zechariah (2 Ki 15:8–11). It is amazing that in spite of the gross wickedness prevailing, a certain measure of religious tolerance was exercised. When Amos, a citizen of the southern kingdom, uttered his prophecies of woe against the house of Jeroboam in the sanctuary city of Bethel, the priest of Bethel reported the matter to the king, yet nothing was done to Amos except that he was bidden to leave the territory of the northern kingdom (Amos 7:10–17).</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "burden" or "to carry a load." He is one of 12 minor prophets sent by God to the northern kingdom of Israel during the time of Jerobaom II (northern kingdom) and Uzziah (southern kingdom). He is a shepherd by trade from Tekoa in Judah.</shortdescription>
    <article>Amos, name means "to lift (a load)," "to carry (a load)". A prophet of the town of Tekoa, in Judah, whom God sent with a message to the northern kingdom, Israel. The book of Amos is a record of that message and of his experience in delivering it. Our knowledge concerning the prophet is meager and must be gleaned from his book.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
His home was in Tekoa, a small town at the edge of the barren Wilderness of Judah that falls away in undulating hills to the Dead Sea, some 12 mi. (c. 19 km.) distant. Prior to his call to the prophetic office Amos was a shepherd who devoted a part of his time to tending sycamore trees and gathering their fruit, which resembles figs (ch 7:14). Although from one of the humbler walks of life, Amos was a man of natural intelligence, of a deeply religious bent, and with shrewd powers of observance. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
He was unassuming, but bold and fearless when called to bear witness against the evils of his day. The message he bore was graphic and powerful. Some have concluded from his mention of five of the neighboring nations that he may have traveled as far as Damascus and Egypt (ch 1).</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "God is my strength." Son of Amaziah, king of Judah, southern kingdom, for 52 years. He is a good king but tolerates some idol worship. His success leads him to enter the temple to presume to do priestly functions, but he gets leprosy.</shortdescription>
    <article>Uzziah, name means "Yahweh is my strength". The 10th ruler of the kingdom of Judah, who reigned for 52 years (c. 790–c. 739 b.c.). He was also called Azariah. This was probably his original name and Uzziah his throne name (2 Ki 15:1 cf. 2 Chr 26:1). Uzziah seems to have been elevated to the position of coregent with his father after his father Amaziah suffered a serious defeat by Jehoash of Israel. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This conclusion can be drawn not only from an interpretation of the chronological data given in the Bible but also from the remark that "he [Azariah] built Elath, … after that the king [Amaziah] slept with his fathers" (2 Ki 14:22 2 Chr 26:2). Apparently his sole reign did not begin until the 27th year (c. 767 b.c.) of Jeroboam II’s reign (2 Ki 15:1), so that the coregency seems to have lasted for about 24 years. Uzziah is known for rebuilding Judah’s army, promoting his country’s agriculture, and reorganizing its defenses (2 Chr 26:9–15). He was also responsible for restoring his nation’s military fame by a number of victories over Philistine cities and Arabian tribes, and by forcing the Ammonites to pay tribute to him (vs 6–8). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
He is described as a good king, although he tolerated the worship of other gods on the high places (2 Ki 15:3, 4 2 Chr 26:4, 5). Finally, however, his success and power led him to presume to enter the Temple in order to exercise priestly functions by offering incense. The high priest Azariah and 80 priests protested against this presumption, and God punished the king with incurable leprosy. From that time until his death he lived as a leper in a separate house, while his son Jotham reigned as coregent (2 Ki 15:5 2 Chr 26:16–21). During Uzziah’s reign the prophets Amos, Hosea, and Isaiah began their ministry (Amos 1:1 Hos 1:1 Is 1:1). A severe earthquake occurred in his time (Amos 1:1 Zec 14:5). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Dr. E. L. Sukenik found a stone tablet in the Russian Archeological Museum on the Mount of Olives in 1931 with the following Aramaic inscription: "Hither were brought the bones of Uzziah king of Judah—do not open". Since this inscription dates from about the time of Christ, it shows that in the beginning of the Christian Era the king’s original tomb, apparently still known to the people at Jerusalem, had been disturbed, and that his bones had been moved to a new resting place, where this tablet seems to have been set up. (W. F. Albright, BASOR 44 [1931], 8–10 E. L. Sukenik, QSPEF 63 [1931], 217–221.)&lt;BR /&gt;

    <article>Menahem, name means "comforter," he is the 17th king of the northern kingdom of Israel (if Tibni is included in the court), who reigned for 10 years (c. 752–c. 742 b.c.). He was probably governor of Tirzah when Shallum, after assassinating Zechariah (probably at Ibleam), made himself king in Samaria. Menahem at once set out for the capital, slew Shallum, and made himself king (2 Ki 15:8–10, 13, 14). To gain Assyrian support for his uncertain position he paid a heavy tribute of 1,000 talents of silver to Tiglath-pileser III (called Pul in v 19). He raised the money by taxing 60,000 wealthy men of Israel to the amount of 50 shekels each (vs 19, 20). The payment of this tribute is mentioned in a cuneiform display inscription of Tiglath-pileser excavated at Calah (ANET 283). King Menahem was evil like his precursors (v 18). At Tiphsah he committed a most atrocious act. The citizens of that place did not want to accept him as king, so he captured the city, killed all the men, and ripped open all pregnant women (v 16).</article>

At first he runs opposite direction but after being thrown overboard and swallowed by a whale and then vomited onto dry land he once more hears the call of God to go to Nineveh. This time he obeys and goes. It was probably in the time of Adad-nirari III 810–782 b.c. that Jonah preached his message of warning in the streets of that city, resulting in temporary repentance and a postponement of the impending doom that had been pronounced over wicked Nineveh Jon 1–4 cf. 2 Ki 14:25.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Uzziah, 10th ruler of the kingdom of Judah for 52 years (also called Azariah) is very prosperous early in his reign, building the army, promoting agriculture, and reorganizing its defense. He has a number of military victories, but he becomes proud.</shortdescription>
    <article>In 2 Chronicles 26 we read of Uzziah’s military adventures, his public works, and his strength in arms. This section is found only in Chronicles and is an important contribution to information regarding the nature of Uzziah’s reign. It is thought that "Azriau of Iauda" in the Assyrian records was Azariah (Uzziah) of Judah. If so, these records (see 2 Kings 14:28 16:5) confirm the picture given in the Bible of Uzziah’s military importance. Tiglath-pileser III has a number of references to "Azriau of Iauda" (see v. 13).</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "God has opened the eyes." He is the son of Remaliah, the 19th king of Israel and usurps the throne by assassinating Pekahiah who he served as an army officer. Hoshea murders Pekah during Tiglath-Pileser's invasion of northern Palestine.</shortdescription>
    <article>Pekah, name means "(God) has opened (the eyes)." The 19th king of Israel, if Tibni is included in the count. He usurped the throne, assassinating Pekahiah, under whom he had served as an army officer. There are reasons—based on certain Judah-Israel synchronisms in 2 Ki and on dates of the contemporary Assyrian kings mentioned in the Bible—for believing that Pekah did not count his 20 years’ reign (2 Ki 15:27) from the time of Pekahiah’s death, but that he also included the reigns of his 2 predecessors and called the year in which he killed Pekahiah his 12th year instead of his first. If so, he actually reigned only about 8 years (c. 740 b.c.-c. 732 b.c.). It is possible that he made a claim to the crown soon after the death of Jeroboam II (c. 753 b.c.), or that he made a claim only after his accession to the throne, contending, however, that he had been the legitimate king during the reigns of Menahem and Pekahiah though not actually ruling, or that he actually ruled for some time over part of eastern Israel, before taking the throne over the entire kingdom. He was an ally of Rezin of Damascus, probably in a coalition with several other local kings of western Asia, against Tiglath-pileser III, as the Assyrian cuneiform records indicate. Apparently Ahaz of Judah did not join this alliance and this may have been the reason why Pekah and Rezin planned to invade Judah, dethrone its king, and replace him with the son of Tabeel, probably an Aramaean (Is 7:1, 5, 6). Rezin marched through Transjordan to the Gulf of Aqabah and took Elath, in which the Edomites afterward settled (2 Ki 16:5, 6 this is according to the Hebrew, but the RSV translators assume that "Syria" was an error for "Edom," and also further emend the text.) Pekah invaded the kingdom of Judah from the north. In desperation Ahaz, against the advice of Isaiah, sent tribute to Tiglath-pileser III, requesting him to attack the countries of his 2 adversaries. The Assyrian king complied by attacking Damascus (2 Ki 16:7–9). Tiglath-pileser also took from Pekah his territories east of the Jordan (1 Chr 5:26), which he organized into the Assyrian "Province of Gilead." It may have been at this time that Pekah withdrew from Judah with much spoil and with prisoners who were later allowed to return to their country when the prophet Oded interceded on their behalf (2 Chr 28:5–21). Tiglath-pileser also invaded northern Palestine and took it, after having occupied Israel’s territory in Transjordan, from Pekah. He organized the occupied territory of northern Palestine into the Assyrian "Province of Megiddo," ruled by an Assyrian governor residing at Megiddo. The coastal area became the Assyrian "Province of Dor." The Assyrian army then moved on to the country of the Philistines. It was probably while Tiglath-pileser was in that area that Hoshea murdered Pekah (2 Ki 15:29, 30), probably with the connivance of Tiglath-pileser III, since that king claims in his inscriptions that he placed Hoshea on the throne.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "Yahweh is perfect." He is son of Uzziah and the 11th king of Judah who reigns for 20 years probably as coregent with his father part of the time. He is described as mostly a good king and is in Matthew's genealogy.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jotham, name means "Yahweh is perfect." The 11th ruler of the kingdom of Judah, who reigned for 20 years (c. 705–c. 731 b.c.). In 2 Ki 15:33 and 2 Chr 27:1, 16 regnal years are attributed and to him. However, in 2 Ki 15:30 the murder of Pekah is put in his 20th year. This apparent discrepancy can be explained by assuming that he abdicated in favor of his son Ahaz after a reign of 16 years, but lived for at least another 4 years, and that the scribes continued to date events according to his reign. He had a coregency with his father Uzziah as well, taking the throne when his father became a leper (2 Ki 15:5 2 Chr 26:21). He is described as a good king like his father, although he allowed the people to worship on the high places, as had been done for centuries (2 Ki 15:34, 35 2 Chr 27:2). He built the high gate of the Temple, repaired the wall at Ophel, south of the Temple, founded cities in the mountainous parts of his country, and erected castles and towers in the forests (2 Ki 15:35 2 Chr 27:3, 4). He defeated the Ammonites and forced them to pay tribute (2 Chr 27:5). In his reign Pekah of Israel and Rezin of Damascus began an invasion of Judah (2 Ki 15:37), possibly because he did not join them in an alliance against Assyria. He is listed in the genealogy of Jesus Christ as recorded by Matthew (Mt 1:9).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <article>Shalmaneser V (727–722 b.c.), son and successor of Tiglath-pileser III. Hardly any contemporary records of this king have survived, and our knowledge of the events of his brief reign depends mainly on the Bible (2 Ki 17:3 2 Ki 18:9) and Josephus (Ant. ix. 14). Early in his reign he carried out a campaign against the Phoenicians. At this time King Hosea of Israel assured Shalmaneser of his loyalty, but later, trusting in Egypt, rebelled against his Assyrian overlord. Shalmaneser marched into Israel and began the 3-year siege of Samaria which ended with the destruction of the city, the deportation of its population, and the cessation of the kingdom of Israel (2 Ki 17:3–6). Although Sargon II, the successor of Shalmaneser, claimed later to have conquered Samaria in his 1st regnal year, the chronological data of the Bible seem to indicate that Samaria fell shortly before Shalmaneser’s death, in 723/22 b.c..</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "Yahweh saves." Son of Amoz and perhaps the greatest of the Old Testament prophets. He lives during the time of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. He lives in Jerusalem and fearlessly rebukes the sins of Judah and is probably a martyr.</shortdescription>
    <article>Isaiah, name means "Yahweh saves." Greatest of the Hebrew prophets and author of the book that bears his name. He was a son of Amoz (Is 1:1 not Amos) and came to the prophetic office toward the close of the reign of Uzziah (Azariah), c. 790–c. 739 b.c. and served also under Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah (d. c. 686). Tradition makes him cousin of Uzziah. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The chronology of Sennacherib’s campaigns into Judah (chs 36 and 37) shows that Isaiah remained active in the prophetic office approximately to the close of Hezekiah’s reign, and that his ministry therefore spanned more than half a cent. Called to be a prophet in his youth, Isaiah fully dedicated himself to God’s service at the time of his only recorded vision, in which a realization of God’s infinite holiness of character effected a more thorough conversion and response on his part than had earlier been experienced (ch 6). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
His contemporaries in the prophetic office were Hosea in the northern kingdom of Israel (Hos 1:1) and Micah in the southern kingdom of Judah (Mic 1:1). Isaiah, an eloquent, educated, and cultured man, lived in Jerusalem and served as the political and religious counselor of the nation. He attempted to hold Judah steady and loyal to God during the turbulent and uncertain years that witnessed the dissolution of the northern kingdom of Israel and its fall in 723/22 b.c., and through the repeated Assyrian invasions of Judah in the years that followed. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Fearlessly he rebuked the sins of the people, counseled the rulers to rely on the Lord instead of depending on entangling foreign alliances, foresaw the Babylonian captivity, and wrote at length concerning the glorious restoration that would culminate in the coming of Messiah and the establishment of His eternal kingdom—should God’s people cooperate with Him. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Isaiah’s influence was largely responsible for the reformation effected by Hezekiah, whom he encouraged and guided throughout his reign. His counsel and admonition were chiefly responsible for persuading king and people to stand firm when Sennacherib threatened to take Jerusalem. According to tradition Isaiah fell a martyr to Hezekiah’s son, Manasseh, who abolished the reforms instituted by his father and, presumably, had the prophet sawn asunder (cf. Heb 11:37).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "Yahweh saves." He is the son of Elah, 20th and last king of Israel northern kingdom. He reigns 9 years and "did evil in the sight of the Lord." He slays Pekah and usurps the throne. He pays tribute to Assyria and is later taken captive.</shortdescription>
    <article>Hoshea, name means "Yahweh saves." The 20th (if Tibni is included) and last king of Israel (732–722 b.c.). With the probable connivance of Tiglath-pileser III, king of Assyria, Hoshea slew Pekah and usurped the throne. When Shalmaneser V, Tiglath-pileser’s successor, appeared in Palestine, Hoshea paid tribute to Assyria and was confirmed in his office. Later, however, he made an alliance with Egypt and broke away from Assyria, with the result that Shalmaneser marched against Israel and besieged Samaria, taking the city after three years. This probably took place in the last year of Shalmaneser’s life, although Sargon II, his successor, claimed to have captured the city. Hoshea was taken captive and incarcerated (2 Ki 15:30 17:1–6).</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "the god has appointed the king." After the death of Shalmaneser he is an Assyrian general who establishes himself on the throne. He claims to have captured Samaria and deported the Israelites and their gods (golden calves).</shortdescription>
    <article>Sargon. The name of several Mesopotamian kings, of whom only Sargon II (722–705 b.c.) of Assyria appears in the Bible. Sargon II is mentioned in the Bible only in Is 20:1, in connection with a campaign against Ashdod. The first Assyrian king’s name to be deciphered was that of Sargon II. The decipherment was made in the middle of the 19th cent. when Assyriology was in its infancy, and by it Biblical archeology gained one of its first triumphs, for the name Sargon had been completely unknown except for the one occurrence of it in the book of Isaiah.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Sargon took the throne of Assyria after the death of Shalmaneser V. He was probably a usurper, although he claimed, according to one preserved text, to have been a son of Tiglath-pileser III. He was a powerful king and a great conqueror, and became the founder of the mightiest dynasty of Assyrian rulers, under whom the empire reached its greatest triumphs. In his later inscriptions he claims to have captured Samaria, and to have deported 27,290 Israelites, and their gods, probably meaning the golden calves that Jeroboam I had set up at Bethel and Dan. However, from the chronological data of the Bible it seems more likely that Samaria fell shortly before Shalmaneser V’s death, when Sargon was still the commander of the army. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Nevertheless, Sargon may have been responsible for the transplantation of the population of Samaria to other parts of the empire (2 Ki 17:6), and the initial settlements of colonists from Babylonia, and other places (v 24) in the territory of Samaria. Sargon carried out many military campaigns during his reign of 17 years, but it is unknown whether he fought against King Hezekiah, although he calls himself the subduer of Judah, and claims that that country paid tribute to him. He is especially well known as the builder of a new capital city, Dûr–Sharrukên, now Khorsabad, about 10 mi. (c. 16 km.) northeast of Nineveh. Dûr–Sharrukên was the first Assyrian palace city excavated. Sargon was succeeded in 705 b.c. by his son Senacherib.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>The most important earthquake mentioned in the Old Testament is spoken of in Amos 1:1 and Zechariah 14:5 and happens during the reign of Uzziah, the 10th ruler of the Judah northern kingdom.</shortdescription>
    <article>Amos 1:1 makes reference to a very important earthquake in Old Testament history. Secular history as yet has thrown no light on this event. However, long afterward the prophet Zechariah mentions this earthquake (see ch. 14:5). Evidently it was serious enough to leave an impression on subsequent generations. Josephus declares that this earthquake came when King Uzziah presumptuously entered the Temple to burn incense (Antiquities ix. 10. 4 see 2 Chron. 26:16–21).</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "Marduk has given a son." The son of Baladan and for a period he is king of Babylon. He sends an embassy to congratulate Hezekiah on his recovery from a deadly disease. Hezekiah shows him his treasury, and Isaiah rebukes him doing this.</shortdescription>
    <article>Merodach-baladan, name means "Marduk has given a son." The son of Baladan and for a time king of Babylon. It was he who sent an embassy to Hezekiah congratulating him on his recovery from a mortal disease (2 Ki 20:12–19 Is 39:1–8 cf. 2 Chr 32:31). Merodach-baladan is a well-known figure from Assyrian records. He was a native and chieftain of a Chaldean tribe, called Bît Yakin, which lived around the mouth of the Euphrates at the Persian Gulf. Merodach-baladan appears first in the Assyrian annals about 731 b.c., when he paid homage and a great tribute to Tiglath-pileser III of Assyria. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Shortly after the death of Shalmaneser V, Merodach-baladan took Babylon and made himself king, holding the throne for nearly 12 years (approximately 721–709 b.c.), according to the canon of Ptolemy and a Babylonian king list. Sargon II, the successor of Shalmaneser V, had suffered a defeat from the Elamites shortly after his accession to the throne, and was therefore forced to recognize Merodach-baladan as king of Babylon. However, in 709 b.c. Sargon felt strong enough to march against Babylon, and took the city, Merodach-baladan having fled. When Sargon fought against Bît Yakin a little later, Merodach-baladan was captured, but was restored to his kingship over his native tribe. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Merodach-baladan again made himself king of Babylon in 703, using the city of Borsippa as his residence. But he could hold out for only about 9 months, after which he was driven away by Senacherib, the son and successor of Sargon II. When Sennacherib continued his campaign toward the south against Bît Yakin, Merodach-baladan fled to the Elamites and from there organized resistance against the Assyrians. It was probably during this time that he sent his ambassadors to Hezekiah, ostensibly to congratulate him upon his recovery, but more likely with the object of concluding a treaty with him against the Assyrians. To impress the envoys of the ex-Babylonian king with his strength, Hezekiah showed them his arsenal and his financial resources, which action was strongly rebuked by the prophet Isaiah (Is 39:1–8).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "possessor" or "he has seized." He is son of Jotham and 12th king of Judah. He is a wicked king who makes his son "pass through the fire." He reigns 16 years and dies at the age of 35 years. He is succeeded by his son Hezekiah.</shortdescription>
    <article>Ahaz, name means "he has seized". The 12th occupant of the throne of the kingdom of Judah, who reigned approximately 20 years (c. 735–c. 715 b.c.), if the years of his presumable coregencies, with his father, Jotham, and with his son Hezekiah are included. After his father’s death he reigned 16 years (2 Ki 16:2 2 Chr 28:1). Ahaz was an idolater, had his son pass through the fire, and worshiped strange gods on high places, on hills, and under trees (2 Ki 16:3, 4 2 Chr 28:2–4, 23–25). Early in his reign, while his father was still alive, Pekah of Israel and Rezin of Damascus began to invade Judah (2 Ki 15:37 16:5). The pretext for this military action was probably a refusal on the part of Ahaz to join these two kings in an alliance against Assyria. It was in connection with this crisis that the prophet Isaiah was sent to Ahaz to assure him of God’s help in his struggle with Israel and the Syrians, and evidently also to warn him against calling for foreign aid (Is 7). Ahaz, however, did not appreciate this counsel and turned to Tiglath-pileser III of Assyria for help, sending him a large gift of money taken from the treasures of the Temple and palace. Tiglath-pileser responded by invading Israel and besieging Damascus (2 Ki 16:5–9 2 Chr 28:6–21). Damascus was captured and Rezin killed, and much territory of Israel was taken from Pekah and made into an Assyrian province (see 2 Ki 15:29). It was probably with the connivance of Tiglath-pileser that Pekah was assassinated by Hoshea, who usurped the throne for himself and was confirmed in his office by the Assyrian king. While Tiglath-pileser was at Damascus Ahaz went up to meet him, apparently to pay homage as a vassal along with the Syrians. He sent home a model of a foreign altar that he had seen in Damascus, with an order to have a similar one built for the Temple at Jerusalem. This was probably an Assyrian altar to be used to worship Assyrian national gods. It replaced Solomon’s altar of burnt offerings (2 Ki 16:10–16). Hosea, Micah, and Isaiah all prophesied during Ahaz’ reign (Hos 1:1 Mic 1:1 Is 1:1 7:1–16). Ahaz is listed in the genealogy of Jesus Christ (Mt 1:9 KJV "Achaz").</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "who is like Yahweh?" He is a Morashite, prophet mostly to the southern kingdom of Judah under the kings Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. He writes a book and is often known as the prophet of social justice with concerns for the common people.</shortdescription>
    <article>Sixth of the so-called Minor Prophets. Micah identifies himself as “the *Morasthite.” The fact that Micah mentions only Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah (Mic 1:1), implies that his ministry was confined largely to the southern kingdom, although his message was applicable also to the people of Samaria (see v 1). A comparison of Mic 1:1 with Is 1:1; 6:1; and Hos 1:1 reveals that Micah’s prophetic ministry began shortly after those of Isaiah and Hosea, and that for a number of years he was contemporary with them. Micah’s ministry thus fell between about 739 and 686 b.c., probably during the earlier portion of this period. Whereas Hosea bore his message exclusively to the northern kingdom, or nearly so (cf. Hos 4:15; 11:12), and Isaiah to the southern kingdom, especially at Jerusalem (Is 1:1), Micah addressed himself to both. Whereas Isaiah reflects the culture of the capital city, Micah is more a man of the common people and sympathizes with them in their suffering at the hand of oppressive landlords and judges. He has been called the prophet of social justice, since he attacks the wrongs to which the poor were exposed at the hands of heartless aristocrats. His style blends severity with tenderness, sternness with sympathy, boldness with love, simplicity with elegance. Abrupt transitions suggest that the book represents a collection of messages given at various times and places, and brought together without an intention to combine them into one unified message. The direct form of address, particularly the questions he asks of the people (chs 1:5; 2:7; 4:9; 6:3, 6, 7, 10, 11), probably vividly reflects the messages as he originally delivered them in oral form. He frequently employs literary devices such as the metaphor (chs 1:6; 3:2, 3, 6; 4:6–8, 13; 6:10, 11, 14, 15) and paronomasia, or play on words, evident in the Hebrew, as with the place names Aphrah (ch 1:10), Maroth (v 12), Lachish (v 13), Moresheth-gath and Achzib (v 14), and Mareshah (v 15). In ch 7:18 Micah apparently plays on his own name. His familiarity with history is reflected in chs 1:13–15; 5; 6:4, 6, 16; 7:20.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Micah’s influence doubtless had a part in the thoroughgoing reforms effected by King Hezekiah, whose father, Ahaz, had gone so far as to set up a heathen altar in the Temple court. Idolatry was rampant throughout Judah, as well as in Israel, and the social injustice against which Micah particularly spoke was the natural result. Even the priests countenanced heathenism in order to retain their popularity with the people. The nobles and wealthier classes had given themselves over to lives of luxury and were unscrupulous and cruel in their dealings with the poorer classes, whom they ground down by excessive exactions and deprived of their legal and moral rights. But, as with most of the OT prophets, Micah’s message had a dark and a bright side. On the one hand he condemned the sins of the people and warned of the result of obstinate persistence in an evil course, and on the other he spoke of the glory and joy of the Messianic kingdom to be established “in the last days” (ch 4:1).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Micah assails the corrupt state of society (Mic 1:1 to 3:12). The “wound” of Judah appears to be “incurable” (ch 1:9), seemingly an allusion to Sennacherib’s invasion described at length in Is 36 and 37. The people of Judah are so engrossed in iniquity and the oppression of their fellow countrymen that they lie awake at night devising new means of oppression (Mic 2:1, 2). Accordingly, God promises to “devise an evil” from which they themselves will not be able to escape (v 3). Micah appeals particularly to the leaders and princes of the people, whose responsibility it was to provide justice for all, but who were figuratively eating the very flesh of the common people and flaying them alive instead (ch 3:1–3). False prophets, dishonest judges, and mercenary priests had become the curse of Israel (vs 5–11), and unless the nation repented, Jerusalem would be devastated (v 12). In chs 4:1 to 5:15 Micah turns the page of prophecy to the glorious future when the “mountain of the house of the Lord,” which would yet be laid desolate as a result of the sins of the people (ch 3:12), was to be “established in the top of the mountains” in glory and honor (ch 4:1). Israel would then fulfill its Messianic role by converting the nations to the worship of the true God (v 2) and thereby bring peace to the earth (vs 3, 4, 7; cf. ch 5:7, 8). The dominion God had originally planned for His people would be theirs (ch 4:8) when Messiah should come to rule over Israel (ch 5:1–5). In ch 6 Micah returns to the Lord’s “controversy with his people” (v 2), and proclaims in plain, simple language what God requires of them—to be fair and kind toward one another, and humble toward God (v 8). Captivity and repentance are foretold in ch 7:1–13 and the prophecy closes with a prayer for reformation and restoration (vs 14–20). </article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "Yahweh has strengthened." He is the son of Ahaz and the 13th king of Judah southern kingdom. He reigns for 29 years as a good king with many accomplishments, including building the Siloam tunnel for bringing water into Jerusalem.</shortdescription>
    <article>Hezekiah, name means "Yahweh has strengthened". The son of Ahaz and the 13th king of Judah. His reign of 29 years (as recorded in 2 Ki 18:2 2 Chr 29:1) is probably reckoned from his father’s death (c. 715 b.c.). During 10 years of the 29 his son Manasseh was probably coregent with him. But apparently Hezekiah had ruled jointly with his father for 14 years before that, thus being on the throne a total of 43 years (c. 729 – c. 686 b.c., according to the synchronisms of the Bible and the Assyrian chronology). Hezekiah was a good ruler and broke with his father’s evil practices as soon as he was free to do so. He repaired and cleansed the Temple, reorganized the religious services, and celebrated a great Passover to which he invited the ten tribes of the north. He removed the high places, destroyed the idols, and even the bronze serpent dating from Moses’ time, since it was being used for idolatrous purposes (2 Ki 18:3–6 2 Chr 29:1 to 31:21). He also had unpublished proverbs of Solomon collected and recorded (Prov 25:1).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
His reign was marked by remarkable prosperity. He gained control over the Philistine Plain (2 Ki 18:8), built store cities and sheepfolds (2 Chr 32:27–29), and fortified the wall of Jerusalem (Is 22:10). But his greatest technical accomplishment was bringing water inside Jerusalem. His rock-cut Siloam tunnel, 1,749 ft. (c. 533 m.) long, connected an old tunnel from the spring of Gihon, in the Kidron Valley, with a new, lower pool inside the city (2 Ki 20:20 2 Chr 32:4, 30 cf. Ecclus 48:17 see Siloam).&lt;BR /&gt;
Hezekiah is best known for his brave fight against the powerful Assyrian Empire, and for his faith in God during one of Sennacherib’s invasions, a faith that was rewarded by a miraculous destruction of a large Assyrian army.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Besides Isaiah, the prophets Hosea and Micah were active in Hezekiah’s time (Hos 1:1 Mic 1:1). When Hezekiah died, c. 686 b.c., his son Manasseh, who seems to have been associated with him for some years on the throne, became sole ruler.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "may the god Sin increase my brothers." He is the son of Sargon II, a great Assyrian king who rules for 25 years. His siege against Lachish is well remembered. He lays siege to Jerusalem but is not successful. Hezekiah pays him tribute.</shortdescription>
    <article>Sennacherib's name means "may (the god) Sin increase my brothers." An Assyrian king who succeeded his father Sargon II in 705 b.c. and ruled for 25 years (705–681 b.c.). He is best remembered in secular history for his senseless destruction of Babylon in 689 b.c. and in the Bible for the catastrophe that overtook his army at Jerusalem shortly afterward. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
On Sennacherib’s accession Merodach-Baladan, former king of Babylon, attempted to throw off the Assyrian yoke, but he and his Elamite ally were defeated. Sennacherib’s next major campaign was carried out in the west in 701 b.c., where a revolt in Syria and Palestine demanded his attention. First he captured a number of Phoenician cities, and then marched against the center of rebellion in Palestine, the Philistine cities and the kingdom of Judah. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Sennacherib claims to have taken 46 fortified cities from Hezekiah of Judah, besides many villages, and to have carried off 200,150 captives (the Assyriologist A. Ungnad believes that the number should be read 2,150), besides tremendous amounts of spoil. His siege of Lachish, probably the strongest fortress city of Judah with the exception of Jerusalem, is mentioned in the Bible (2 Ki 18:14, 17 19:8) and also depicted by Sennacherib on long stone reliefs. Jerusalem was besieged for a time by an Assyrian army, but was not taken (ch 18:17). So Sennacherib could claim only that he had made Hezekiah "a prisoner in Jerusalem, his royal residence, like a bird in a cage. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
I surrounded him with earthwork in order to molest those who were leaving the city’s gate". Since his attention was urgently needed in the east, Sennacherib had to be satisfied with receiving a heavy tribute from Hezekiah, which is mentioned in the Bible and in the Assyrian king’s records (2 Ki 18:14–16). The detailed Assyrian version of this campaign, inscribed on well-preserved clay prisms , agrees in all major points with the Biblical records, although it shows differences in details.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
During the next 10 years Sennacherib was kept busy mainly with affairs in Babylonia and Elam. Finally he became so weary of the frequent rebellions of Babylon that he destroyed the city ruthlessly and thoroughly, and even flooded the whole area by diverting the Euphrates, in order to transform the surrounding land into a marsh and thus prevent the city’s resurrection. Shortly afterward he must have carried out another military campaign against Hezekiah, because 2 Ki 19:9 mentions an attempt of Tirhakah, the Nubian king of Egypt, to aid Hezekiah during a campaign of Sennacherib. Since Tirhakah did not leave Nubia, his homeland, until about 689 b.c., when he became coregent with his brother at the age of 20, this campaign cannot be dated earlier. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Therefore it must be concluded that the Biblical records of chs 18–20 and parallel passages deal with 2 distinct campaigns and not with one, as a cursory reading of the narrative seems to indicate. It must have been during this later campaign that Sennacherib’s army suffered the disastrous loss recorded in ch 19:35, when it was smitten by an angel during the siege of Jerusalem. Although the Assyrian records naturally are silent about this disaster, it was not forgotten among the ancient nations, as is proved by a story of the Greek historian Herodotus. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
While visiting Egypt more than 200 years after Sennacherib’s death Herodotus was told that when the Assyrian king advanced against Egypt, immense numbers of mice ate the bowstrings of his army so that the soldiers fled in panic. Since the mice were considered the bearers of bubonic plague, it is generally believed that the story implies an outbreak of this disease in the army of the Assyrians. There is little reason to doubt that this was the Egyptian version of the catastrophe recorded in v. 35.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In his homeland Sennacherib was known as the great rebuilder of Nineveh, which in his time became the most beautiful and glorious city of antiquity. He also built an aqueduct that brought water to Nineveh and its surrounding area from the eastern mountains some 30 mi. (c. 48 km.) away. The Gomer River was spanned by an arched causeway 1,000 ft. (c. 300 m.) long, possibly the first permanent stone bridge of history. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In 681 b.c. Sennacherib was murdered by his 2 sons, Adrammelech and Sharezer, who were perhaps jealous of their brother Esarhaddon, the crown prince. Although this murder is referred to in several contemporary texts, all references to it are so vague and ambiguous that a detailed historical reconstruction of the event is still impossible. The murderers did not succeed in usurping the throne, but were driven out by Esarhaddon, who succeeded his father.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "God is with us." Name of a sign-child spoken to Ahaz by Isaiah which was to be a sign of Judah's promised deliverance. Ahaz kept turning from God. Isaiah later applies the name to the land of Judah. It's supreme fulfillment is in Jesus.</shortdescription>
    <article>Immanuel, name means "God is with us". The sign-child foretold by the prophet Isaiah in conversation with Ahaz, king of Judah (Is 7:14), applied by Matthew to Jesus of Nazareth (Mt 1:23). Alarmed at an alliance between Pekah, king of Israel, and Rezin, king of Syria, against Judah (Is 7:2, 5, 6), Ahaz turned to Tiglath-pileser III, king of Assyria, for help (2 Ki 16:6–9 2 Chr 28:16 Is 8:9–12). Anticipating imminent attack, Ahaz went out to inspect the water supply of the city. Isaiah met him on the way with the message not to fear Pekah and Rezin but to trust in the Lord (Is 7:4–7 8:13, 14). In token of the promised deliverance, Isaiah, whose name means "Yahweh saves," foretold the birth of a son to be named Immanuel, meaning "God is with us," as a token and reminder of God’s abiding presence. Before this sign-child should reach the age of accountability Pekah and Rezin would both fall before the Assyrians (ch 8:7, 8, 16). This prediction, made about 734 b.c., was literally fulfilled. Tiglath-pileser captured Damascus and killed Rezin 2 years later (2 Ki 16:9, 10), then devastated Gilead and Galilee, took a vast number of captives, and arranged for the assassination of Pekah (2 Ki 15:29, 30 1 Chr 5:26 Is 8:4). The kingdom of Israel disappeared altogether 12 years later, with the fall of Samaria to the Assyrians in 723/22 b.c. (cf. Is 7:8). Repeated Assyrian invasions during the next few years also devastated all the land of Judah, except for Jerusalem itself (2 Ki 18:13 to 19:34 2 Chr 32:1–20 Is 36:1 to 37:20). Nevertheless, God was with His people to spare the remnant in Jerusalem in a miraculous way (2 Ki 19:35–37 2 Chr 32:21, 22 Is 37:21–38). Had Ahaz trusted the Lord, Judah would have been spared this fearful experience altogether, as implied in the name of the sign-child—"God is with us" (Is 7:14). But Ahaz’ persistent refusal to rely on the Lord instead of on the Assyrian alliance resulted in great suffering for Judah (ch 8:7, 8, 21, 22). In irony the prophet speaks of Judah as Immanuel’s land—"God is with us"—comparing what actually took place with what might have been (vs 8, 10).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Matthew (Mt 1:23 cf. Is 7:14) quotes Is 7:14 and applies it to Christ. The name Immanuel thus originated in an actual historical situation as a promise that God would be with His people to deliver them from their immediate enemies. But Isaiah also looked forward by inspiration to the time when God would send His own Son, the true Immanuel, who would deliver His people from all their enemies. By inspiration Matthew thus picked up the prophecy of Isaiah and declared that it was to meet its fulfillment in the person of Jesus Christ, who was born of a virgin, and who was in the supreme sense "God with us."</article>

    <shortdescription>Chaldeans succeeded more than once in taking over control of Babylon, eventually founding the Chaldean Empire of the Neo-Babylonian period.</shortdescription>
    <article>A tribe of Lower Mesopotamia closely related to the Aramaeans. They appear for the first time in Assyrian records of the time of Ashurnasirpal II 884–859 b.c., which show that they were founders of several tribes, of which the best known was that of Bît¯Yakin, which settled on the western side of the Tigris River at the head of the Persian Gulf, and which constantly threatened Babylon. Chaldeans succeeded several times in gaining control of Babylonia before the founding of the Chaldean Empire. For example, Ukinzer made himself king of Babylon 732/31–729 b.c., and Mardukapaliddina, the Merodach-baladan of the Bible, accomplished this feat twice 721–710/09 and 703–702 b.c.. Nabopolassar 626–605 b.c., the founder of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, was a Chaldean. It is to this Chaldean or Neo-Babylonian Empire that the Bible refers when speaking of the Chaldean nation Jer 21:4 Eze 1:3 etc..&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Hezekiah is a good king, unlike his father. He repairs the Temple and organizes religious services. He also invites the 10 northern tribes to come to Jerusalem to celebrate Passover. It is an unusual time of reformation.</shortdescription>
    <article>Hezekiah invites both Israel and Judah to celebrate the Passover. This shows Hezekiah’s concern not only for Judah but also for Israel. Having restored the worship in the Temple, he sent letters throughout the territory of Israel inviting its people to come to the Passover service. Ephraim and Manasseh were the principal tribes in the territory of the northern kingdom not yet carried into captivity. The tribes east of the Jordan and the northern tribes had earlier suffered deportation (2 Kings 15:29 1 Chron. 5:26). The event took place in the second month. The work of cleansing and sanctifying the Temple was not completed till the 16th day of the 1st month (ch. 29:17), and the Passover service ordinarily began on the 14th day of the 1st month (Ex. 12:2, 6 Lev. 23:5). But in cases of emergency the law permitted individuals to observe the Passover on the 14th day of the 2d month (Num. 9:6–11).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The government of Judah decreed that word should be sent to the inhabitants of Israel inviting them to the Passover. The narrative does not imply that the proclamation itself was of the nature of an official decree. Hezekiah could hardly have made an official proclamation in Hoshea’s kingdom without the cooperation of the Israelite king, and the narrative indicates no such cooperation.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In the days of Rehoboam of Judah many of the faithful in Israel forsook their nation that they might worship the Lord at Jerusalem (ch. 11:16, 17), and in the days of Asa many Israelites again joined their brethren in Judah ch. 15:9). Jeroboam had established the worship of the golden calves at Bethel and Dan to keep his people from going to Jerusalem to worship (1 Kings 12:27–33), and Baasha fortified Ramah, near the border, to prevent the Israelites from falling away to Judah (2 Chron. 16:1). But now again, after so long a time, the situation was open for an invitation to worship at Jerusalem. Hoshea, a puppet of Assyria (see on 2 Kings 17:1), ruling over an already partly dismembered kingdom, was probably either too weak or too indifferent to interfere with Hezekiah’s messengers. The attitude of the northern tribes was, as a whole, one of hostility to God and His worship. In spite of the general hostility, some from the northern tribes responded to Hezekiah’s gracious invitation and came to Jerusalem for the Passover service. No matter how widespread apostasy may be, the Lord always has a faithful few who remain loyal to Him (see Rom. 9:27 Rom. 11:3, 5).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The last previous occasion when it was possible for the people of both Israel and Judah to join in such a festival in Jerusalem was at the time of Solomon, when the kingdom was still united. After the disruption no common religious services that would include the citizens of both nations were possible, except as Israelites left the northern kingdom to migrate to Judah. Now the northern nation was so weakened that it again was possible for the Israelites who desired, to come to Jerusalem for worship.</article>

    <shortdescription>During Hoshea's wicked reign in Israel, Assyria besieges Samaria for three years and carries Israel away to Assyria because of their sins against God.</shortdescription>
    <article>The Bible mentions Shalmaneser as beginning the siege, but does not name the king who took the city. The Babylonian Chronicle states that the city Shamarain (probably Samaria) fell during the reign of Shalmaneser, but his successor, Sargon II, made the claim, in documents written toward the close of his reign, that he himself captured the city of Samaria at the beginning of his reign. If this claim is true, then it could have been in the capacity of commanding general of the Assyrian armies and not as king that he effected the capture of the city. Historians differ, but there seems to be reasonable evidence for its fall in the latter part of Shalmaneser’s reign.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Israel had sinned. This was the primary reason for Israel’s downfall. They could hardly display baser ingratitude than to forget God’s mercy and goodness. Idolatry involved infinitely more guilt among the Hebrews than among other peoples, for the heathen had only a limited degree of enlightenment and had not experienced the wonderful blessings that God had bestowed on His chosen people. The Israelites knew by their own personal experience that God was kind and beneficent, and yet in spite of all this they turned away from Him to the worship of false gods.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The rulers of Israel were responsible for leading their people into sin. They introduced and encouraged the worship of such false gods as Baal, and turned the people from the worship of Jehovah to the most corrupt forms of worship. Nevertheless, the people were not thereby without excuse. Men are held responsible individually for their acts. The wrongdoing of the leader provides no excuse for the followers to adopt the same sinful course. However, the Israelites were largely dependent upon oral instruction. Copies of the Law were rare, and few, if any, were privileged to have the Holy Scriptures in their homes. The people received their knowledge of the will of God through the priests and other religious leaders. If these spiritual instructors were themselves teaching and practicing evil, the natural result would be for those under their charge to follow the same course. The majority of the Israelites lacked a personal religious experience.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
So, they were carried off. A small remnant remained (see 2 Chron. 34:9). These intermarried with the heathen, adopted their ways, and so far forgot the customs of their fathers that the people of Judah refused to regard them as brethren. After some years they established a temple of their own on Mt. Gerizim, where they worshiped and carried on their ritual as a rival to that of the Temple at Jerusalem. The people who were carried away never returned. Some of their descendants joined the remnant of Judah who returned under the decree of Cyrus (Ezra 1:1–4). Others intermarried with the peoples where they lived, accepted their religion and their ways, and lost their identity. A few, no doubt, remained true to their religious convictions, letting their light shine in the lands to which they were carried, and influencing some there to accept the worship of the only true God.</article>

    <shortdescription>Shalmaneser begins a 3-year siege against Samaria. Sargon II claims in documents found that he captured the city. The Israelites are taken captive and scattered so that "there was none left" (2 Ki. 17:18) because of their great sins against God.</shortdescription>
    <article>Shalmaneser began a three-year siege (see on ch. 18:9, 10) of Samaria. The Bible mentions Shalmaneser as beginning the siege, but does not name the king who took the city. The Babylonian Chronicle states that the city Shamarain (probably Samaria) fell during the reign of Shalmaneser, but his successor, Sargon II, made the claim, in documents written toward the close of his reign, that he himself captured the city of Samaria at the beginning of his reign. If this claim is true, then it could have been in the capacity of commanding general of the Assyrian armies and not as king that he effected the capture of the city. Historians differ, but there seems to be reasonable evidence for its fall in the latter part of Shalmaneser’s reign.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The plural "they" is of interest in reference to who took the city. It might refer to the Assyrians in general, but that is hardly likely, for the previous verse speaks of Shalmaneser as coming against Samaria and besieging it. It has been suggested that the "they" here probably refers to Shalmaneser and someone associated with him. This may have been Shalmaneser’s general and successor on the throne, Sargon.</article>

    <shortdescription>According to the Bible, King Hezekiah built a tunnel to bring water into the city of Jerusalem. In 1880 a Hebrew inscription of 6 lines was discovered on the wall that describes the process of digging the tunnel.</shortdescription>
    <article>In 1880 an interesting inscription was discovered on the walls of this tunnel, written in Hebrew, and thought to belong to the time of Hezekiah. It tells how the workmen beginning at both ends and excavating toward each other, finally met in the center. The achievement of Hezekiah’s engineers was an amazing device whereby a supply of water was insured to the residents of the city in time of siege. Comparable tunnels are found at Gezer and Megiddo. It said:&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
"[… when] (the tunnel) was driven through. And this was the way in which it was cut through:—While […] (were) still […] axe (s), each man toward his fellow, and while there were still three cubits to be cut through, [there was heard] the voice of a man calling to his fellow, for there was an overlap in the rock on the right [and on the left]. And when the tunnel was driven through, the quarrymen hewed (the rock), each man toward his fellow, axe against axe and the water flowed from the spring toward the reservoir for 1,200 cubits, and the height of the rock above the head (s) of the quarrymen was 100 cubits" (W. F. Albright).</article>

Upon his accession Esarhaddon began to rebuild Babylon, which his father had destroyed. Since his mother was a Babylonian princess, he was more favorably disposed to the Babylonians than was his father. Esarhaddon is especially known for his conquest of Egypt, which he organized into an Assyrian province. He also waged successful wars against Phoenician and Syrian kings. He had himself depicted on monuments as holding in his right hand ropes attached to rings in the lips of the Egyptian king Taharka (Biblical Tirhakah) and the king of Tyre, one of whom kneels and the other stands shackled before him . In the Bible Esarhaddon is mentioned as the successor or Sennacherib (2 Ki 19:37 Is 37:38), and as the Assyrian king who settled foreign colonists in Samaria (Ezr 4:2). In his inscriptions he claims that King Manasseh of Judah paid tribute to him. Whether Esarhaddon himself or his son Ashurbanipal was responsible for exiling Manasseh of Israel temporarily to Babylon (2 Chr 33:11–13) is not known.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "making to forget." He is the son of Hezekiah and the 14th king of Judah who reigns for 55 years. He doesn't follow Hezekiah's good example and erects altars to Baal and sacrifices one of his sons to fire. He later repents in Assyria.</shortdescription>
    <article>Manasseh was the 14th ruler of the kingdom of Judah he reigned for 55 years (c. 697 c. 642 b.c.), during part of which he was apparently coregent with his father Hezekiah. An ancient Hebrew seal, published in 1963, bears the inscription "Belonging to Manasseh, son of the king." On paleographic grounds the seal can be dated to either the 8th or the 7th cent. b.c. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It is therefore possible that this seal belonged to Manasseh, King Hezekiah’s son, before he ascended the throne, though it may have belonged to another royal prince of the same name who lived somewhat earlier or later than King Manasseh. He did not follow his father’s good example, but was more wicked than any of his predecessors. He re-established the high places, erected an altar to Baal, and made a cult object to Asherah. He worshiped many other gods in the Temple courts, and sacrificed one of his sons by fire. He ignored the prophets’ warnings of the consequences of his evildoings and persecuted many followers of the true God, as the statement that he shed much innocent blood obviously indicates (2 Ki 21:1–16 2 Chr 33:1–10). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As a punishment for his wicked deeds God delivered him into the hands of the Assyrian kings. Both Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal mention Manasseh as having paid tribute to them, one king spelling his name Menasi and the other Minsie. Yet he seems to have been a disloyal vassal, for on one occasion he was taken captive to Babylon—which was at that time part of the Assyrian Empire—by either Esarhaddon or Ashurbanipal. However, he was allowed to return when the Assyrian king apparently became convinced that Manasseh would henceforth be loyal. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Although a non-Biblical record of Manasseh’s captivity has not yet been found in cuneiform sources, the experience is not without parallels. For example, the Egyptian ruler Necho (I), king of Sai¨s, was made vassal king of Egypt by Esarhaddon. After Esarhaddon’s death Necho rebelled against Assyria, and was taken to Mesopotamia as a prisoner. While there he succeeded in gaining the confidence of Ashurbanipal, who pardoned him and restored him to his throne in Sai¨s. While captive in Babylon, Manasseh repented, and after his return to Jerusalem he tried to undo his former wickedness by removing idolatry from his kingdom and from the Temple. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Yet he did not abolish the high places, although he allowed worship only of the true God in them. The chronicler records that he engaged in extensive building activity in Jerusalem and that he strengthened the army (2 Chr 33:11–17). After a reign of more years than that of any other Hebrew king, Manasseh died, leaving the throne to his son Amon. He was buried in the garden of his own house (2 Ki 21:18 2 Chr 33:20).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Hezekiah becomes very sick &amp; near death. Isaiah tells him he will die. Hezekiah cries out to God who hears &amp; promises 15 more years of life. He asks for a sign and the sun dial moves back 10 degrees. He later shows his treasures to Berodach-Baladan.</shortdescription>
    <article>Hezekiah's sickeness was about the time of Sennacherib’s first invasion in Hezekiah’s 14th year. In connection with the promise of Hezekiah’s healing, the Lord said that He would deliver Jerusalem out of the hand of the king of Assyria and that He would add 15 years to Hezekiah’s reign (ch. 20:6). This fits in with the details of Sennacherib’s first campaign against Judah in Hezekiah’s 14th year (see on ch. 18:13), and the fact that Hezekiah reigned 29 years (ch. 18:2). Parallel accounts of Hezekiah’s illness and recovery are found in Isa. 38, 39 and in 2 Chron. 32:24–31.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When the prophet told Hezekiah he would die, Hezekiah did not conclude that it was useless to pray, as though the prophetic message had made death inevitable. If we pray, God may be able to do for us that which He could not do if we did not pray. Requests for healing, however, must be made in the spirit of submission. God alone knows whether the answering of a petition will work for the good of those concerned and redound to His glory. In praying for the sick some have made the mistake of almost demanding that the life of the sufferer be given to them. In many instances the lives of those who were thus spared did not bring glory to God. It would have been better for these souls to have passed to their rest while the hope of salvation was theirs. The extension of Hezekiah’s life led to the one great mistake in the king’s life (vs. 12–19). If he had added to his prayer "nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt" (Matt. 26:39), he might have died with his life’s record unblemished.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Hezekiah’s answer came speedily. Before Isaiah had left the precincts of the palace he was bidden to return. God always hears the man who pours out his soul in earnest prayer. The answer may not be as expected, or as immediate or direct as was the case with Hezekiah, but the Lord hears nevertheless, and works all things for good for those who love Him (Rom. 8:28).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Hezekiah desired an immediate token that the Lord would do what He had said He would (see on Joshua 7:14 Judges 6:36). In the ordinary course of events the shadow on a sundial would gradually advance with the forward motion of the sun, but for it suddenly to retrogress would be a most remarkable occurrence, and for this reason Hezekiah chose this sign. There is no benefit to be derived from speculating as to how God performs His miracles. The sign came as a direct interposition by God.</article>

    <shortdescription>During the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah, Sennacherib takes 46 fortified cities. Hezekiah pays tribute to him. But Isaiah predicts they will not take Jerusalem. God will protect a remnant.</shortdescription>
    <article>In 2 Kings 18 we read of the first of Sennacherib’s famous campaigns against Hezekiah. The narrative runs from chs. 18:13 to 19:37. The same account, in practically identical language, is found in the 36th and 37th chs. of Isaiah. This would suggest that Isaiah was the author of this portion of 2 Kings. A somewhat abbreviated history in 2 Chron. 32:1–22 gives details of Hezekiah’s war preparations.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Scholars disagree as to whether the narrative describes one or two campaigns. The majority of modern commentators have held that the account describes one campaign and that the events all belong in Hezekiah’s 14th year, 701 b.c. Others have held that the account blends the records of two Assyrian campaigns, the first in the 14th year of Hezekiah’s reign, in which the fenced cities of Judah were taken, and the second late in Hezekiah’s reign when a large section of the Assyrian army was destroyed (ch. 19:35). In favor of the former view is the fact that there seems to be no natural break in the Bible narrative. Furthermore Assyrian sources describe a campaign of Sennacherib generally dated in the year 701 b.c., but make no positive mention of a later campaign, against Judah, although the records may be incomplete, or it may be Sennacherib purposely omitted from his annals a record of his defeat. Concerning the campaign of 701 b.c., Sennacherib claims that he shut up "Hezekiah like a caged bird," a description that equally fits a campaign over-running the fenced cities of Judah as well as one more definitely threatening Jerusalem.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Hezekiah’s extensive preparations for defense (see 2 Chron. 32:2–6) suggest some considerable interval between the two campaigns also the fact that the Bible narrative seems to indicate that the death of Sennacherib took place shortly after his return from his unsuccessful attempt against Jerusalem. If there was only the one campaign in 701 b.c. his assassination would come some 20 years after his return to Assyria. Furthermore, inscriptions in which Tirhakah (ch. 19:9) gives his age as 20 years at the time when he became coregent with his brother in 690 b.c., indicate that he was born about the year 709 b.c. This would make it impossible for him to have taken part in the events described if they occurred in the year 701 b.c. It was formerly held that though he did not become king of Egypt till about 690 b.c., he might have been a general of the army. If Tirhakah’s statements concerning his age are correct the only way to synchronize the statement of ch. 19:9 with its context is to assume a second campaign toward the close of Hezekiah’s reign. Evidently the fenced cities were taken and tribute paid in the first campaign, and Jerusalem saved by divine interposition in the second. It is inconsequential that opinions differ as to where the division comes in the narrative, which was written to show God’s overruling care for those who seek Him, not to furnish a chronological outline. Sennacherib claims the capture of 46 walled cities of Judah.</article>

A prince of royal blood could more easily and effectively denounce the sins of the nobility and princes (ch 1:8). Although Zephaniah has left us a short book of prophecies, he provides no information about himself other than that found in v 1, and we know nothing about his life since he is mentioned nowhere else in the Bible.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Isaiah makes an amazing prediction about Cyrus, a heathen king, whom he names before his birth as one who would restore Israel from Babylonian captivity. It shows God's foreknowledge and sovereignty.</shortdescription>
    <article>This is a remarkable prophecy in that it mentions Cyrus by name, a century and a half before his time, and foretells the remarkable part he was to play in the liberation of the Jews (for a similar advance prophecy given concerning Josiah’s reform see 1 Kings 13:2). Cyrus must have been greatly astonished to learn that a Jewish prophecy named him, described his capture of Babylon, and predicted his policy toward the captive Jews, a century and a half before his birth. He refers to Cyrus as "My shepherd." In overthrowing Babylon and liberating the Jews, Cyrus did for literal Israel what Christ will accomplish for all His chosen ones in the overthrow of mystical Babylon and the deliverance of His people from her dominion (Rev. 18:2–4, 20 Rev. 19:1, 2). Soon after capturing Babylon, Cyrus issued the decree that permitted the captive Jews to return to their homeland and rebuild the Temple (2 Chron. 36:22, 23 see Ezra 1:1–4).</article>

    <shortdescription>Zephaniah dates his message to King Josiah, who reigns from about 640 B.C. to 609 B.C. He predicts the overthrow of Assyria, so his ministry takes place probably in the last part of Josiah's reign. He lives during Habakkuk's time.</shortdescription>
    <article>The book of Zephaniah, like that of Joel, focuses on "the day of the Lord." For the meaning of this expression see on Isa. 2:12. Not only does the prophet reveal the coming judgment upon Israel he also warns of punishment to come upon other nations. However, if Zephaniah alarms by his severe judgments, it is only that the people may repent, may "seek righteousness, seek meekness" (ch. 2:3), and thus escape the punishment.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "consolation" or "comforted one." A minor prophet of Judah from the 7th century BC and is identified as an Elkoshite in the Old Testament book which bears his name. His prophecy is primarily focused on the doom of the Assyrian empire.</shortdescription>
    <article>Seventh of the so-called Minor Prophets. Reference in Nah 3:8–10 to the fall of No (Thebes), which was destroyed by Ashurbanipal of Assyria in 663 b.c., suggests that Nahum wrote his book shortly after that date. Nahum foretells the desolation of Nineveh (ch 3:7), the Assyrian capital, an event that took place in 612 b.c., and his book may therefore be dated between 663 and 612 b.c., perhaps c. 640 b.c. The book of Nahum announces the doom of the great Assyrian Empire at the very time when the nation was at the crest of its power (see Assyria). Jerusalem and Judah had been suffering repeated Assyrian invasions and had been forced to pay tribute intermittently for 3/4 of a century. Assyria appeared invincible, but God prophesied through Nahum that He would break the Assyrian yoke (ch 1:13). This message assured the faithful in Judah that God was still watching over His people and that He would visit justice upon their oppressors. During Ashurbanipal’s reign (669–627? b.c.) most of the nations of the Fertile Crescent, from Mesopotamia to Egypt, either were subject to the Assyrians or were under tribute to them. However, before his death, possibly in 627 b.c., the situation had already begun to change. Soon thereafter the empire disintegrated, and Nineveh itself fell in 612 b.c. to the Medes and the Babylonians.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The book of Nahum is concerned exclusively with the coming fate of Nineveh. About a century and a half before Nahum, Jonah went to the city with a call to repentance, and for a time king and people alike humbled themselves before God (Jon 3:5–10). Accordingly, for a time, the city was spared. But the reformation did not last, and Nahum now predicted the imminent destruction of the “bloody city” (Nah 3:1). A century prior to Nahum’s time Assyria had been the “rod” of God’s anger (Is 10:5) against the northern kingdom, Israel, whose 10 tribes it took captive. A few years later, under Sennacherib, God used the same rod to chasten the people of Jerusalem and Judah (chs 36; 37; cf. 8:7, 8). But by their monumental pride and unabashed cruelty the Assyrians had now filled their cup of iniquity. They were defying the sovereignty of the God of heaven and were abasing the Creator of the universe to a level with idols (ch 36:7, 14–20). Assyria had refused to cooperate with God’s purpose for her as a nation and therefore lost her mandate to rule.&lt;BR /&gt;
The prophecy of Nahum is written in poetic style, its 1st chapter being an alphabetic psalm (see Acrostic) of unusual form. Although in the text as it has come down to us some letters of the alphabet are missing and others appear out of sequence, it is quite possible that originally the alphabetical arrangement was complete. Each letter of the alphabet introduces a new thought. Thus in v 5 the 1st member of the poetic parallelism, “the mountains quake at him, and the hills melt,” begins with the Hebrew letter he’, while the 2d, “and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein,” begins with waw, the next letter in the Hebrew alphabet.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The prophecy logically falls into 2 parts: (1) an ascription of praise, extolling God as merciful and just, as the ruler of the world and arbiter of national destiny (Nah 1:1–10), and (2) a vivid description of the fall of Nineveh (chs 1:11 to 3:19). Nahum entitles his prophecy “The burden of Nineveh.” God takes the enemies of His people to be His own “adversaries” (ch 1:2). Though He is “slow to anger” He will not forever countenance their wickedness (v 3). The forces of nature—the sea, the rivers, the mountains, the earth itself—are subject to His pleasure (vs 4–6). To His own people He is “a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust him” (v 7). When He sets His hand to punish the Assyrians “he will make an utter end,” and never again will the Assyrians rise to oppress His people (v 9). For some time God has permitted them to prosper (v 12), but the time is at hand when He will break the Assyrian yoke and restore peace to Judah (vs 13–15). The destroyer is depicted as laying siege to Nineveh, and in irony God summons its garrison to prepare to defend the city (ch 2:1). The shields of the defenders are red, apparently with blood, and the chariots rumble through the streets to the point of attack (vs 3, 4). The warriors stumble at their appointed places on the city wall (v 5), the sluice gates are opened, and the palace is inundated (v 6). As its inhabitants tremble in fear, the invaders rush into the city, and take its spoil (vs 7–10). ch 3 pictures the horsemen lifting their spears and swords in battle and multitudes falling down slain (ch 3:1–3). God is against Nineveh because of her crimes, her immorality, and her oppression of others (vs 4–6), and therefore lays the city waste (v 7). It is no better than the city of No (Thebes) of Egypt or of other nations that have fallen (vs 7–9). Its people are taken captive or scattered leaderless upon the mountains, and the “shepherds,” the leaders of Assyria, are laid to rest in the dust. Nineveh’s wound is a mortal one, and “there is no healing” of the bruise it now suffers (vs 10–19).</article>

    <article>Sennacherib became so incensed at these frequent rebellions that he systematically and thoroughly destroyed the city in 689 b.c., intending that it should not be rebuilt. However, public opinion even in his homeland was against so rash a deed, and the rebuilding of the city began immediately after Sennacherib’s death.</article>

    <shortdescription>Esarhaddon was the first Assyrian king to conquer Egypt. He organized into the vast Assyrian empire of the 8th century BC.</shortdescription>
    <article>An Assyrian king, the son and successor of Sennacherib he reigned 681–669 b.c. Upon his accession Esarhaddon began to rebuild Babylon, which his father had destroyed. Since his mother was a Babylonian princess, he was more favorably disposed to the Babylonians than was his father. Esarhaddon is especially known for his conquest of Egypt, which he organized into an Assyrian province. He also waged successful wars against Phoenician and Syrian kings. He had himself depicted on monuments as holding in his right hand ropes attached to rings in the lips of the Egyptian king Taharka Biblical Tirhakah and the king of Tyre, one of whom kneels and the other stands shackled before him.&lt;BR /&gt;

Thebes had been destroyed in 663 b.c. by Ashurbanipal, king of Assyria.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "Yahweh heals." He is the son of Amon and 16th ruler of Judah who reigns for 31 years. He becomes king at age 8. He begins great religious reforms which come with the discovery of the Law scrolls in the Temple and seeks to destroy idols.</shortdescription>
    <article>Josiah, name means "Yahweh heals," though the real meaning of the name is obscure. The 16th ruler of the kingdom of Judah, who reigned for 31 years (c. 640–c. 609 b.c.). He became king at the age of 8 years, his father Amon having been slain by the royal courtiers (2 Chr 33:21–24 2 Chr 34:1). In his 12th regnal year, when about 20 years old, he began to purge his country of the high places, destroying Baal altars, Asherah cult images, and other pagan vestiges (ch 34:3–7). His religious activity extended to the territory of the former kingdom of Israel (v 6), the weakness of Assyria during those years being in his favor. It is possible that the Assyrian provinces of Megiddo and Samaria had ceased to function, and that Josiah entered into the political vacuum and established his own authority in that area. Later he was able to choose Megiddo, a city in the heart of the old northern kingdom, to meet Pharaoh Necho’s army with his own armed forces.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The greatest event in his life came in his 18th regnal year, when the discovery of a scroll of the Law of Moses in the Temple incited a national religious revival. The message of the scroll, when read to the king, made a deep impression upon him. Convinced that his fathers had not lived according to the divine ordinances, he feared that the curses pronounced by Moses would fall upon him and his kingdom, and consequently sent certain officials to the prophetess Huldah for advice. She confirmed the king’s forebodings, but assured him that God would not bring the predicted punishments upon Judah during his lifetime, since he had done everything in his power to live a godly life (2 Ki 22:8–20 2 Chr 34:14–28). Josiah now doubled his efforts to stamp out idolatry and paganism from the kingdom, and induced the leadership of the country to enter into a solemn covenant with God. He celebrated the Passover in a way it had not been celebrated since the days of Samuel (2 Ki 23:1–25).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "Yahweh is exalted." One of the greatest of the Old Testament prophets, the son of Hilkiah a high priest, who works during the time of King Josiah and Zedekiah. He calls for cooperation with Babylon during the captivity, very unpopular.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jeremiah, name means "Yahweh is exalted," or possibly "Yahweh strikes." A prophet who encourage the work of reform under King Josiah. He counseled the Jews in Jerusalem prior to and during the Babylonian captivity and wrote the book that bears his name. Jeremiah is perhaps the most colorful of all the OT prophets. Interspersed with his prophetic messages are frequent glimpses into his own soul that give a vivid picture of the feelings and experience of a prophet who was called to bear unpopular messages in a time of national crisis. Jeremiah’s prophetic ministry continued for more than 40 years, beginning about 626 b.c. (Jer 1:2) and extending beyond the Captivity in 586 b.c. (ch 39:1, 2)—perhaps the most critical period of Israelite history in all OT times.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The history of the southern kingdom of Judah since the captivity of the 10 tribes a century earlier was one of deepening national apostasy. By Jeremiah’s time it had become apparent that drastic measures must be taken if God’s purpose for Israel was ever to be fulfilled. Canaan was theirs only by virtue of their covenant relationship with God, and by their persistent violation of the covenant provisions they forfeited their right to the land. Captivity was inevitable, not as retributive punishment but as remedial discipline, and it fell to Jeremiah to explain the reasons for the Captivity and to encourage cooperation with God’s plan in that experience. Again and again, through Jeremiah, God appealed to His people to submit to the king of Babylon and to be willing to learn the lesson this bitter experience was ordained to teach. The 1st captivity came in 605 b.c., but their refusal to cooperate led to a 2d in 597 b.c., and a 3d in 586 b.c. that was accompanied by the utter desolation of the city and the Temple. Ezekiel was called to a similar role for the exiles in Babylonia, and about the same time God appointed Daniel to the court of Nebuchadnezzar for the purpose of mitigating the natural harshness and severity of the Babylonians toward the Jews. The messages of Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel were designed to make clear the nature and purpose of the Captivity and to hasten the return of the exiles to their homeland.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <article>Neco. KJV Necho and Nechoh. A Pharaoh of Egypt, generally known as Necho II. He was the son of Psamtik I, the Pharaoh who founded the 26th dynasty of Egypt. Necho reigned from 610 to 595 b.c. He continued the policy of his father, who had aided the hard-pressed remnants of the Assyrians after the fall of Nineveh, considering it in the interest of Egypt to keep alive the Assyrian kingdom of Ashur-uballit as a buffer state between Egypt and Babylonia. It was in 609 b.c., according to the Biblical chronology adopted for this dictionary, that Josiah of Judah attempted to halt Necho’s march toward the north, but in the ensuing battle at Megiddo Josiah was mortally wounded (2 Ki 23:29 2 Chr 35:20, 21–23). After Necho had consolidated his power over Syria and Phoenicia, he summoned Jehoahaz, Josiah’s son, to Riblah in Syria, his headquarters, and deposed him after Jehoahaz had reigned only 3 months, made Jehoahaz’ brother Jehoiakim king, and laid a heavy tribute upon Judah (2 Ki 23:33–35). In 605 b.c. the Chaldean forces, commanded by the crown prince Nebuchadnezzar, decisively beat Necho at Carchemish and again near Hamath. Egypt at that time escaped an invasion of the Chaldeans only because of the sudden death of Nabopolassar, Nebuchadnezzar’s father, which forced Nebuchadnezzar to abandon any plan of invading Egypt at that time. The next clash between Necho and Nebuchadnezzar came in 601 b.c., according to the recently discovered tablets of the Babylonian Chronicle. This battle ended in a defeat or near defeat for Nebuchadnezzar, as may be concluded from the information that his army suffered so great losses that during the next year he could not go on a military campaign, but had to stay in Babylon to reinforce his troops. However, Necho must also have lost heavily because he seems to have been unable to follow up his victory and reoccupy his lost Asiatic possessions. In fact, he ventured no more into the area claimed by the Babylonians (2 Ki 24:7). Necho sponsored the immigration of Greek colonists, is credited with having spent much energy digging a canal between the Red Sea and the Nile, which remained uncompleted until the time of Darius I, and had Africa circumnavigated by Phoenician sailors.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "Yahweh raises up." He is the 18th ruler of the southern kingdom of Judah and reigns for 11 years. He is the son of Josiah but does not live like his father. He is an evil king and rebels against Nebuchadnezzar. He is captured and dies.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jehoiakim, name means "Yahweh raises up." The 18th ruler of the southern kingdom of Judah, who reigned for 11 years (609–598 b.c.) He was the second son of Josiah (1 Chr 3:15), and followed his younger brother, Jehoahaz, on the throne, when Jehoahaz was deposed by Pharaoh Necho and carried captive to Egypt. Jehoiakim’s original name was Eliakim, "God raises up," but Necho changed it to Jehoiakim, which became his throne name (2 Ki 23:34 2 Chr 36:4). Jehoiakim seems to have belonged to the pro-Egyptian party, as indicated by the fact that Necho considered him a trustworthy candidate for the kingship in Judah. In order to pay the heavy tribute laid upon him by Necho, Jehoiakim taxed the whole population (2 Ki 23:35). He is described as a wicked king (2 Ki 23:37 2 Chr 36:5), who quickly undid everything his pious father Josiah had achieved in religious reforms. During his reign Jeremiah bade Baruch, his servant, put in writing and read publicly a prophecy predicting Judah’s inevitable doom. When Jehoiakim learned about it he requested that the scroll be read before him. Annoyed at its contents, he destroyed it, and ordered the arrest of Jeremiah and Baruch (Jer 36). Another prophet, Uriah, who proclaimed the same message of doom, was executed (ch 26:20–23).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
During the first 3 years of his reign Jehoiakim was apparently a vassal of the Egyptian king. However, in 605 b.c. Nebuchadnezzar decisively defeated the Egyptian army at Carchemish and entered Palestine. Jehoiakim surrendered, and Nebuchadnezzar carried away some of the Temple vessels and a group of hostages, among whom were Daniel and his three friends (Dan 1:1–6). This event must have taken place shortly before the death of Nabopolassar, Nebuchadnezzar’s father, for the news of Nabopolassar’s death reached Nebuchadnezzar while he was on his way to Egypt. Jehoiakim became Nebuchadnezzar’s vassal for 3 years, but rebelled (2 Ki 24:1), apparently at a time of resurgence of Egyptian power, for in 601 b.c. Egypt succeeded in inflicting heavy losses on Nebuchadnezzar’s army, as the Babylonian Chronicle reveals. Nebuchadnezzar then allowed Judah’s neighboring nations and his own garrison stationed near Judah to invade Jehoiakim’s kingdom. The Babylonians captured Jehoiakim, but he seems to have died before he could be transported to Babylon, possibly by accident or possibly as the result of rough treatment from the Babylonian soldiers (2 Ki 24:2 2 Chr 36:6). His death must have occurred in early Dec., 598 b.c., because the date of his son Jehoiachin’s captivity, which occurred after a reign of only 3 months and 10 days (2 Chr 36:9) is, on evidence found in the Babylonian Chronicle, placed at March 16, 597 b.c. The king’s death was not lamented. His body was cast outside the gate of Jerusalem and was finally unceremoniously buried (Jer 22:18, 19 36:30). His son Jehoiachin followed him (2 Chr 36:8).</article>

    <shortdescription>In his 12th year of reign, Josiah begins to cleanse Judah of the "high places" and destroy the Baal altars, Asherah images, and all traces of paganism. His work extends into Israel in the north. In his 18th year the Law of Moses scroll is found.</shortdescription>
    <article>Josiah was only 16 years of age (see v. 1) when he began to consider seriously his responsibility. The record does not place the entire reformation in the 12th year, but only its beginning. The first campaign resulted in the destruction of idolatrous objects throughout the country, but the reform was not complete. The 18th year found idolatry still firmly entrenched in the popular mind. The narrative of Josiah’s measures against idolatry in the 12th year is similar to the account of 2 Kings 23, which, however, places the events in the 18th year. Perhaps the Kings account covers the whole period of reform since its beginning in the 12th year.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "Nebo protector of the crown." He is the son and successor of Nabopolassar, and is the greatest and most powerful of the Babylonian kings who carried Daniel and his 3 friends into captivity. Daniel interprets this king's amazing dream.</shortdescription>
    <article>Nebuchadnezzar, name means "May (the god) Nabu protect the son," or "May Nabu protect the boundary." The name of 2 Babylonian kings, of whom only Nebuchadnezzar II, the 2d king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire (605–562 b.c.), played a role in Biblical history. He is especially known for his conquest of Jerusalem and for the rebuilding of Babylon. The many inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar that have come to light during the last century speak almost exclusively of his building activities at Babylon and other places only a few historical texts deal with events of his reign. Until 1956 virtually all historical knowledge about Nebuchadnezzar was obtained from the Bible and Josephus, but the tablets of the Babylonian Chronicle, discovered in 1956, covering the first 11 years of his reign are perhaps the harbingers of more to come in the field of historical texts dealing with Nebuchadnezzar’s time.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Before he reached the border of Egypt, Nebuchadnezzar received the news that his father had died on Abu (Ab) 8 (approximately Aug. 15, 605 b.c.), and hastened home to secure the throne. From now on we find Nebuchadnezzar in Syria or Palestine practically every year. However, in 601 b.c. he suffered a defeat or a near defeat from the Egyptians and consequently stayed at home during the next year (600 b.c.) to rebuild his depleted army. The rising power of the Egyptians that led to this defeat was probably the reason that Jehoiakim of Judah risked refusal to pay the annual tribute to Babylon (2 Ki 24:1), thinking that the balance of power had swayed in favor of Egypt. In 599/98 b.c. Nebuchadnezzar’s forces went to Syria-Palestine but were engaged in fighting against Arab tribes. Nebuchadnezzar again turned his attention toward Judah the next year. Jehoiakim had died before Nebuchadnezzar arrived and his son Jehoiachin was on the throne. Nebuchadnezzar took the city on Adar 2 (approximately March 16), 597 b.c. sent Jehoiachin captive to Babylon with 10,000 of his most distinguished citizens (vs 8–15), among whom was the prophet Ezekiel (Eze 1:1, 2 33:21) and made Jehoiachin’s uncle, Zedekiah, king of Judah in Jehoiachin’s stead (2 Ki 24:17). When the new king several years later rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar the Babylonians returned and took Jerusalem after a siege of over 2 years, in the 19th year of Nebuchadnezzar, that is, in the summer of 586 b.c. They destroyed Jerusalem and the Temple and deported the majority of the remaining population to Babylon (2 Ki 25:8–11). Nebuchadnezzar also subjugated Tyre after a siege of 13 years (see Eze 26:1 to 28:19 Jos. Against Apion i. 21). A fragmentary inscription mentions a military campaign also against the Pharaoh Amasis of Egypt in Nebuchadnezzar’s 37th regnal year (ANET 308 see also Jer 42:7–18 Eze 29:17–21).&lt;BR /&gt;
Dan 1–4 describes the experiences of Daniel under Nebuchadnezzar and tells how the king became acquainted with the Hebrew religion and Daniel’s God. The king’s mental incapacity for 7 years (ch 4) is known only from the Bible, since such misfortunes were rarely recorded by court officials. However, it is possible that a fragmentary cuneiform tablet in the British Museum, published in 1975, refers to Nebuchadnezzar’s mental illness, for it says of the king that "life appeared of no value to" him, that "he does not show love to son and daughter," and that "family and clan does not exist" for him any longer (A. K. Grayson, Babylonian Historical-Literary Texts [Toronto, 1975], pp. 88–92). When Nebuchadnezzar died in 562 b.c. his son Amel-Marduk, the Biblical Evil-Merodach, succeeded him on the throne. For Nebuchadnezzar’s extended building activity in his capital city, see Babylon.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "Yahweh has grasped my hand." He is Josiah's third son (often called Shallum) who succeeds his father on the throne and reigns over Judah for 3 months. He practices idolatry and is taken by Pharaoh Necho to Egypt where he dies.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jehoahaz is the 17th king of Judah (2 Ki 23:31), who reigned only 3 months (609 b.c.). His original name was Shallum (1 Chr 3:15 Jer 22:11, 12 cf. 2 Ki 23:31). He probably took the name Jehoahaz as his throne name. After his father was killed in the battle of Megiddo, fighting against Pharaoh Necho, Jehoahaz was put on the throne by popular demand, although he was not the eldest prince. Belonging probably to the anti-Egyptian party, Jehoahaz continued his father’s policies, and after a reign of 3 months was summoned to Riblah in Syria by Necho, who replaced him by his older brother Jehoiakim. He was then deported to Egypt, where he died (2 Ki 23:31–34 2 Chr 36:1, 4). A seal of the late 7th cent. b.c. bears the Hebrew inscription, "Belonging to Jehoahaz, son of the king." It may have belonged to Josiah’s son Jehoahaz before he was placed on the throne.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "God will strengthen." He is the son of Buzi, a priest born in Judah and taken to Babylon with a group, then went into captivity with Jehoiachin. He is a prophet for 22 years and a messenger to God's people in captivity. He wrote a book.</shortdescription>
    <article>Ezekiel, name means "God will strengthen." A priest, the son of Buzi, born in Judah but transported to Babylonia with the group that went into captivity with Jehoiachin in 597 b.c. (Eze 1:1–3). He was then about 25 years of age if "the thirtieth year" (ch 1:1) is a referrence to his age. He was with a group of Jews settled at Tel-abib (chs 1:1, 3 3:15) by "the river Chebar" (ch 1:1), an irrigation canal known from cuneiform records as Nâr Kabari, which passed the city of Nippur. Archeological evidence testifies to a large Jewish settlement in this vicinity during the time of the Babylonian captivity. Ezekiel was happily married, but his wife died about 9 years after their captivity began (ch 24:1, 16). He seems to have had a house of his own (Eze 3:24 8:1 cf. Jer 29:5). In the 5th year of his captivity he was called to the prophetic office (Eze 1:2, 3 2 3), and served in this capacity for some 22 years (ch 29:17), from about 593 to 571 b.c.. At a time when the Temple lay in ruins and the people were in exile it was particularly appropriate that the offices of priest and prophet should be united in one person. Jeremiah, whose ministry was, in part, contemporary with that of Ezekiel, was likewise a priest-prophet (Jer 1:1), as was Zechariah, and also doubtless others (Zec 1:1 cf. Ezr 5:1 6:14 Neh 12:4, 16). In a special sense Ezekiel was God’s messenger to the Jews in captivity, as Jeremiah was to the Jews who remained in Judah and Jerusalem, and as Daniel was to Nebuchadnezzar and the court at Babylon. All 3 were divinely commissioned with the purpose of securing the divine objectives in the Captivity. Apparently Ezekiel was well liked by the people to whom he bore his inspired messages, but his mission seems to have met with limited success (Eze 20:49 33:32).</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "God is my judge." A captive brought to Babylon who comes from the royal family. A man of talent and physique, he earns the respect of the king's court and becomes a statesmen to Nebuchadnezzar. He is also a great prophet given visions.</shortdescription>
    <article>Daniel, name means "God is my judge." Jewish statesman and prophet at the court of Nebuchadnezzar during the Babylonian captivity, and author of the book that bears his name. Daniel was of the royal family (Dan 1:3), and thus of the tribe of Judah. He was obviously a young man at the time he was taken captive, for his foreign service, first, for a time, at the court of Babylon, and again briefly under the Persian Empire, spanned a period of at least 67 years. Being a prince and a youth of ability and promise (ch 1:3, 4), he was selected, along with others, for a 3-year course of training designed to qualify him for service at court (vs 5, 19). The curriculum consisted among other things of "the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans [Aramaic]" (v 4). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Students taking this course were considered as members of the court and enjoyed certain special privileges (v 5). Apparently from the very first Daniel’s gracious personality and integrity of character won him the favor of the court officials in whose charge he was placed (Dan 1:8, 9). These qualities soon won for him the opportunity of demonstrating the advantages of a healthful diet (vs 8–16). At the close of the course (3 years, inclusive), Daniel and his 3 companions graduated with highest honors (vs 17–20). Thus even before Daniel formally entered upon his service at court he had earned the respect and confidence of the king and his courtiers, having given evidence of a gracious personality, a healthy physique, and superior intellect—in addition to native talent and integrity of character.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Soon thereafter a situation arose that, in God’s providence, launched Daniel on his career as a minister and adviser to the king (Dan 2). Nebuchadnezzar had a dream of a great image, which, most particularly its spectacular climax, was well calculated to arouse the interest of an idolatrous monarch. When he awoke he found that the contents of the dream had been erased from his memory. He summoned his wise men to declare it to him, but they finally admitted that none but "the gods" could answer the king’s queries (vs 10, 11). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This set the stage for Daniel to prove his own acquaintance with the God of heaven, who not only revealed the dream but so interpreted it as to win Nebuchadnezzar’s complete confidence in Daniel as a representative of the true God (vs 46–49). After the passage of an unspecified period of time, Nebuchadnezzar erected a magnificent golden image and required all his officials to bow before it (ch 3). This golden image was probably designed to represent an empire that would never end, in defiance of the prediction in the dream of ch 2 that envisioned Babylon giving way to another world power (Dan 2:38, 39). For some reason Daniel was apparently not summoned.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
After the passage of another unspecified period of time, and apparently toward the close of Nebuchadnezzar’s long reign, the king again dismissed the God of heaven from his mind (Dan 4:4, 30). God accorded him another dream that presaged his humiliation (vs 5–18), and once more Daniel proved to be the only one able to interpret it (vs 19–27). After the humiliating experience foretold by the dream (vs 28–34), the king testified publicly to the greatness of God, to his own submission to God, and implied his own readiness to cooperate with the divine plan for his reign (vs 1–3, 34–37). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
But Nebuchadnezzar’s successors on the throne of Babylon, though they knew all this, refused to follow his course of submission to the will of God (ch 5:22), and actually defied Him (vs 2–4, 23). This persistent and obdurate refusal to comply with the divine plan brought about the downfall of the kingdom only a few years prior to the termination of the 70 years of captivity (Jer 25:12 29:10 Dan 9:1, 2). Daniel’s subsequent installation as a high official in the Persian Empire gave him an opportunity to testify to his faith before the leaders of the nation that was destined of God to bring about the predicted return of the Jews to their homeland and to assist in re-establishing them there. His deliverance from the lions’ den resulted in the recognition of Daniel as an ambassador of the court of heaven (Dan 6:22–28), and doubtless opened the way for him to call attention to the prophecies about Cyrus and his role in the restoration of Jerusalem (Is 44:24 to 45:13).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
On at least four occasions Daniel was the recipient of divine revelation, first the vision of Dan 7 early in Belshazzar’s reign, second the vision of ch 8 two years later, third the communication of ch 9 after the conquest of Babylon by the Persians, and fourth the vision of ch 10 and the lengthy explanation that followed it, as recorded in chs 11 and 12 in the 3d year of the new empire. Thus Daniel lived at least till the 3d year of Cyrus, and was at that time almost 90 years of age.</article>

    <shortdescription>While in captivity in Babylon, Ezekiel learns that his wife will die. The Lord instructs him not to mourn in the usual fashion. The people inquire of the prophet-priest the strange meaning of his actions. The sanctuary will be destroyed.</shortdescription>
    <article>Ezekiel is informed that his wife, whom he deeply loves, is about to die. We need not infer from the language used here that her death was the result of a direct stroke by God. His wife may have been ill for some time, and God may have warned him of her approaching death. By figure God is frequently said to do that which He permits or does not prevent (see 2 Chron. 18:18). It is Satan who is the author of sin, suffering, and death. However, God delights to take that which the enemy brings upon us to annoy, and make it serve some good end (see Rom. 8:28). Here the loss of the desire of Ezekiel’s eyes was used to impress vividly upon the minds of the people the divine message.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "Yahweh is righteousness." He is the 3rd son of Josiah and the 20th and last ruler of the kingdom of Judah before the destruction of Jerusalem. He is appointed king by Nebuchadnezzar after Jehoiachin is deported, but is a weak king.</shortdescription>
    <article>Zedekiah, name means "Yahweh is righteousness," or "righteousness is Yahweh." The 20th and last ruler of the southern kingdom of Judah, who reigned for 11 years (597–586 b.c.). His original name was Mattaniah, but Nebuchadnezzar changed it to Zedekiah when he appointed him king in place of his nephew Jehoiachin (2 Ki 24:17 1 Chr 3:15). In 2 Chr 36:9, 10 he is called Jehoiachin’s brother, meaning "kinsman," as the word *"brother" is sometimes used in the Bible. His appointment to the kingship after the capture of Jerusalem and the deportation of Jehoiachin by Nebuchadnezzar in 597 b.c. is also referred to in recently discovered tablets of the Babylonian Chronicle, although his name is not mentioned in the record.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Zedekiah had a weak character. Though he was occasionally inclined to follow Jeremiah (Jer 38:14–26), he did not have the moral strength to withstand the pressure of the people around him. He tolerated the pollution of the Temple and gross injustice throughout the nation. A strong anti-Babylonian party exercised much pressure upon him to shake off the foreign yoke, and envoys from the surrounding nations were found in Jerusalem, probably to plot against Nebuchadnezzar (Jer 27:1–22). Zedekiah tried to withstand them for a while. Once he sent envoys to Babylonia, presumably with tribute and assurances of his loyalty to Nebuchadnezzar, and in his 4th regnal year he went to Babylon himself, probably for the same purpose (chs 29:3 51:59). It is possible, though purely conjectural, that this visit may have been connected with the dedication of the great image erected in the plain of Dura (Dan 3). Zedekiah finally succumbed to the pressure of the anti-Babylonians among his citizens and trusting in the help of Egypt, rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar. The result of this faithlessness was an invasion of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar, which ended in the 3d capture of Jerusalem in 20 years, the city’s total destruction, the end of the kingdom of Judah, and the deportation of the greater part of the citizens of Judah.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The final siege was begun on the 10th day of the 10th month in the 9th regnal year of Zedekiah (Jer 52:4), most likely on approximately Jan. 15, 588 b.c. Once it was temporarily lifted when an Egyptian army attempted to bring relief (ch 37:5). After a long siege, during which appalling famine conditions prevailed in the city, the Babylonians broke through the walls on the 9th day of the 4th month of Zedekiah’s 11th year, the 19th year of Nebuchadnezzar (ch 52:5, 6 cf. v 12), approximately July 19, 586 b.c. In the ensuing confusion Zedekiah was able to escape from Jerusalem. However, the Chaldeans learned of his escape, pursued him, and captured him near Jericho. He was then taken to Nebuchadnezzar, who had made Riblah in central Syria his headquarters. After his sons were killed in his sight, Nebuchadnezzar put his eyes out, and transported him to Babylon in chains, where he remained a prisoner until he died.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "Yahweh establishes." He is the 19th ruler of the southern kingdom of Judah and follows his father Jehoiakim. He rules for 3 months and 10 days and is then taken captive to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar where he dies.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jehoiachin, name means "Yahweh establishes". The 19th ruler of the southern kingdom of Judah, who reigned only 3 months and 10 days (598–597 b.c.). He was the son and successor of Jehoiakim, and came to the throne at the age of 18 years (2 Ki 24:8). In 2 Chr 36:9 his age is given as 8 years, with the Syriac and LXX versions, however, reading "18." That 18 is correct is shown by the fact that he was old enough to have "wives" (2 Ki 24:15) when he was taken captive to Babylon at the close of his brief reign. According to cuneiform tablets in Babylonia he was the father of 5 sons only 5 years later. Thus he must have been 18, not 8, years old when he became king.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Babylonian Chronicle published in 1956 dealing with the 7th Babylonian year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign (598/97 b.c.) describes the capture of Jerusalem in 597 b.c. and Jehoiachin’s captivity as well as his uncle’s accession to the throne in the following brief sentences: Nebuchadnezzar "encamped against the city of Judah and on the 2d day of the month of Adar he seized the city and captured the king. He appointed there a king of his own choice (lit. "heart"), received its heavy tribute and sent (them) to Babylon." This text gives an exact date for the beginning of Jehoiachin’s captivity, which, in terms of our calendar, was approximately March 16, 597 b.c.. The young king surrendered to Nebuchadnezzar and was subsequently carried away captive to Babylon, along with his mother, his wives, his courtiers, and some 10,000 other captives, among whom was the prophet Ezekiel (2 Ki 24:10–16 2 Chr 36:9, 10 Eze 1:1–3 33:21). Jehoiachin’s uncle, Zedekiah (2 Ki 24:17), was placed on the throne in his stead.</article>

    <shortdescription>Nahum and Zephaniah predicted that this great Assyrian capital would be destroyed. The armies of Babylon and the Medes laid siege to Nineveh and after 3 months it fell. The city was completely destroyed and actually forgotten for a time.</shortdescription>
    <article>Nineveh, a city on the eastern bank of the Tigris, at the mouth of a small tributary now known as the Khosr, opposite the present city of Mosul. The city was founded by Nimrod (Gen 10:11). Excavations have brought to light remains that go back to very ancient times. It was probably in the time of Adad-nirari III (810–782 b.c.) that Jonah preached his message of warning in the streets of that city, resulting in temporary repentance and a postponement of the impending doom that had been pronounced over wicked Nineveh (Jon 1–4 cf. 2 Ki 14:25).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Nineveh’s most glorious period began with Sennacherib (705–681 b.c.). From that time on it remained the undisputed capital of the country until its destruction in 612 b.c. Sennacherib built a great platform within the city and erected his palace on top of it. He built a 2d palace in another part of the city, rebuilt the fortification system and beautified the city’s 15 gates, the names of which are known to us through a cuneiform text. His son Esarhaddon (681–669 b.c.) added a new palace, and so did Ashurbanipal (669–627? b.c.), the great lover of books, who installed in his palace the first large private library of which we have record (now in the British Museum), and which has given us more information about the ancient world than any other single discovery ever made in Bible lands. Ashurbanipal’s successors, Ashur-etil-ilani and Sin-shar-ishkun (although it is possible that the two names were borne by only one individual), were not strong enough to keep the empire intact, and were soon put on the defensive by Nabopolassar, who had made himself king of Babylon in 626 b.c., and by the Medes. In 614 b.c. Asshur fell to the Medes, as did probably also Calah, and 2 years later (612 b.c.) the combined armies of Babylon and of the Medes laid siege to old Nineveh, a city that had seen no hostile foreign armies for centuries. After 3 months the city fell to the attackers, and Sin-shar-ishkun died with his whole palace retinue in the flames of his palace, to which, according to Greek sources, he himself had put the torch. Thus began to be fulfilled the prophecies of Nahum (Nah 2 and 3) and of Zephaniah (Zep 2:13–15) dealing with Nineveh’s doom. The large city not only was completely destroyed, but was actually forgotten in a short time. When Xenophon with his armed forces passed its ruins some 2 cent. later, he could not even learn the real name of the great metropolis that once had flourished there. For many centuries no one knew where Nineveh had been located, although some travelers who visited Assyria in the course of the centuries made a right guess when they saw the tremendous heaps of ruins across the river from Mosul.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Details of the last years of the Assyrian Empire are meager for lack of clear historical records. Two of Ashurbanipal’s sons ruled for a few years over Assyria, but were unable to cope with the forces that were gathering against the Assyrian Empire, especially the Babylonians and the Medes. The former, who had proclaimed their independence under Nabopolassar in 626 b.c., were subsequently at almost continual war with the Assyrians. In 614 b.c. the Medes under Cyaxares destroyed the city of Asshur, and Nineveh shared the same fate 2 years later 612 b.c. when it fell to the combined armies of Cyaxares and Nabopolassar. The last king of Assyria, a certain Ashur-uballit II, was able to rally some of the remnant Assyrian forces around him and retreat to Haran, which he made the capital for a short time. However, the Babylonians soon evicted him from the city, and with his eviction the Assyrians vanished from history c. 609 b.c..</article>

    <shortdescription>Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, has a dream of a great image. He awakens and is troubled by the dream. He calls for his wise men to tell him the dream. They cannot and are condemned to die. But Daniel prays and God reveals it to him.</shortdescription>
    <article>Over 2,600 years ago an ancient king had a dream about a great image made of different metals. When he awoke he was disturbed by the vision and called his wise men to tell him the dream and interpret it. When they could not he was enraged and planned to destroy them. Then a young man named Daniel came forward and offered to reveal and interpret the dream. That night God laid open the vision to Daniel who then told the king. Daniel was honored by the king for explaining the dream. The story is found in Daniel 2, a prophetic book of the Old Testament.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
God revealed a sweeping panorama of world history to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. In the dream he saw a giant statute made of various metals. The head of the huge idol was made of gold, the chest and arms were of silver, the thighs of brass, the legs of iron, and the feet of iron mixed with clay. In the dream the king saw a stone smashing the image to pieces. The broken statute was ground to pieces like chaff and the wind blew it away. Finally, the stone grew to a great mountain that filled the entire earth.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The king probably sat on the edge of his seat wondering, “What does the dream mean?” Daniel then interpreted the dream to the king. The dream presents four world empires that would each successively rule. After these four kingdoms a conglomeration of weak and strong nations would exist. The changes in the value of metal from the head of the statue to the feet indicate that the glory of each kingdom would decrease compared to the one before. As the hardness of the metals, from head to foot, increase, so the strength of each successive empire would be greater.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Kingdom of Gold: Babylon&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Babylon is presented by the head of gold. It ruled from 605 B.C. to 539 B.C. It was a kingdom literally embellished with gold. Its capital rivaled no other nation that followed. Babylon is legendary for its beautiful hanging gardens. Its kings thought their city to be unconquerable. The city’s massive walls seemed impossible to penetrate. Yet, just as the Bible predicted, Babylon was conquered by Cyrus, king of the Persian Empire.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Kingdom of Silver: Medo-Persia&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Medo-Persia was the next world empire represented by the statue’s chest and arms of silver. It is described as an “inferior” kingdom and ruled from 539 B.C. to 331 B.C. The older Median and newer Persian empires overthrew Babylon. The Bible even predicted 100 years in advance the name of the general (Isaiah 44:27, 28 45:1).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Kingdom of Brass: Greece&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Greece, we know from our world history books, was the next conquering kingdom of the world described in the image as brass. Alexander’s empire was known for its vast territory. Much of the Grecians armor was made of brass. The Greeks ruled from 331 B.C. to 168 B.C. It was later divided into four kingdoms before being conquered by the next empire.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Kingdom of Iron: Rome&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Rome was the last and the strongest of the four kingdoms. It is appropriately depicted by the strong metal of iron and lasted the longest, from 168 B.C. to A.D. 351. As predicted in the dream, no other single kingdom ruled the world after the Roman Empire. Rome has been described as an “iron monarchy” and became a world power through might and force.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Kingdom of Clay: Divided Rome&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
The feet of the image were made of iron mixed with clay indicating the Roman Empire would be divided into partly weak and partly strong nations. Barbarians invaded Rome and a mixture of ten countries formed the foundation of modern Europe today. Though many world powers have tried to unite these nations, the Bible correctly predicted “they will not adhere to one another” (Daniel 2:43).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;The Kingdom Still to Come: Stone Cut without Hands&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
The dramatic climax of King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream was to see a stone “cut out without hands” strike the image and break it to pieces. To an idolatrous king who thought his kingdom would stand forever, the God of heaven revealed that earthly kingdoms will all pass away. The movement of nations is not in the hand of any human ruler. God ultimately directs the temporal affairs of earth and His kingdom will be established forever. No human effort will set up Christ’s glorious kingdom that will come at the second coming of Jesus.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Daniel ends his presentation to King Nebuchadnezzar by saying, “The dream is certain, and its interpretation is sure” (Daniel 2:45). Historical records have confirmed these words and we now live “in the toes” of this image waiting for the great day when Christ will come and set up His kingdom that will last forever.</article>

    <shortdescription>The head of gold in Nebuchadnezzar's dream of a great image represents the kingdom of Babylon. Identifying this first kingdom during the time of Daniel gives a strong starting place for understanding those which follow.</shortdescription>
    <article>The head of gold refers to the Kingdom of Babylon. Daniel speaks of Nebuchadnezzar as a "King of kings." This same title is found in the inscription of the Persian king Ariaramnes, a contemporary of Nebuchadnezzar. In his inscriptions Nebuchadnezzar attributes his regal success to his god Marduk, but Daniel, in a kindly manner, corrects this mistaken idea. He affirms that it is the God of heaven who has bestowed such power upon him.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The territory that Nebuchadnezzar ruled had had a long and checkered history and had been under the varied leadership of different peoples and kingdoms. According to Genesis, the city of Babylon was part of the kingdom founded by Nimrod, the great-grandson of Noah (Gen. 10:8–10). A number of city-states existed in the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates at a very early period. Later, some states were grouped together into several Sumerian kingdoms. Following the first period of Sumer’s domination came the kingdom of Akkad, with its great Semitic kings Sargon and Naram-Sin. However, these Semites were again replaced by various nations, such as the Guti, Elamites, and Sumerians. They in turn had to give way to the Semites who founded the Old Babylonian Empire, which flourished in the time of the later patriarchs. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This Amorite Empire, of which Hammurabi was the most important king, came to include all of Mesopotamia and expanded into Syria, like the Akkadian Empire of Sargon. Later, Mesopotamia was taken over by Hurrians and Kassites, and Babylonia became less important than the powerful Hittite and Egyptian empires. Then in northern Mesopotamia arose another world power, the Assyrian Empire, which again united Mesopotamia and Western Asia to the Mediterranean. After a period of Assyrian domination Babylon became independent again under Chaldean rule, and took over once more the leadership of the world. Nabopolassar (626–605 B.C.) was the founder of what is termed the Chaldean, or Neo-Babylonian, Empire, which had its golden age in the days of King Nebuchadnezzar (605–562 B.C.), and lasted until Babylon fell to the Medes and Persians in 539.</article>

    <shortdescription>Daniel has a vision of four beasts coming out of the sea. Like the image of Daniel 2, these beasts represent different kingdoms that will successively rule the earth. Daniel receives a pictorial view of world history through symbols of animals.</shortdescription>
    <article>Daniel 7 contains a strange vision. The prophet sees four winds stirring up the sea. Suddenly, from out of the waters emerge four different beasts. The first was like a lion with eagle’s wings. Its wings are plucked off and the animal turns into a man with a heart. The second beast was like a bear. It was raised up on one side and had three ribs in its mouth. The third was like a leopard with four wings. It also had four heads. But the strangest animal was yet to come.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The fourth beast was unlike Daniel had ever seen before. It was indescribable and unlike the other three. This monster was “terrible, dreadful, and exceedingly strong.” It had large iron teeth and it devoured everything in its pathway. Strangely it had 10 horns. While the prophet looked at the horns it noticed a little horn growing up from among the 10 horns and plucking out three of them. The little horn had the eyes of a man and spoke “pompous” words.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Then Daniel saw thrones and the “Ancient of Days” described wearing a garment white as snow with thousands ministering before him. A judgment scene was taking place in the context of the “pompous words” of the little horn. Finally, one like “the Son of Man” came to the “Ancient of Days”. He was given everlasting dominion and all people served Him. His kingdom would never be destroyed.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The vision deeply troubled Daniel. In his dream he approached someone “who stood by” and asked for an explanation.  The interpretation given echoes the vision of Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel 2, but with more details about the fourth beast. The interpreter said that the four beasts represented four kingdoms. From a study of Daniel 2 and world history, it is not difficult to determine these four kingdoms.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;The First Three Kingdoms&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Babylon is represented as a lion with eagle’s wings. The two great carnivorous animals of the land and sky depict this noble kingdom.  Modern archaeological discoveries of ancient Babylon have revealed the symbol of a lion with wings like an eagle was used in its architecture and design. Perhaps the “man’s heart” given to this kingdom represents the humbling experience of Nebuchadnezzar spoken of in Daniel 4.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Medo-Persia is appropriately represented by a bear lifted up on one side since the declining Median Empire became integrated into the newer and growing Persian Empire. The three ribs in the bear’s mouth are victims of its conquering description, “Rise, devour much flesh!” The three are most likely Lydia, Babylon, and Egypt which Medo-Persia conquered.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Greece, under the leadership of Alexander the Great, conquered the world with great speed. Its armies moved swiftly. The likeness of a leopard with wings fits the Grecian Empire. But, why four heads? After Alexander the Great died his kingdom was divided into four territories: Macedonia, Pergamum, Egypt, and Syria).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Fourth Beast and the Little Horn&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Rome represents the fourth beast. Not only is this confirmed through a study of world history, but Daniel 2 and the great image in Nebuchadnezzar’s vision of the fourth kingdom points to this “iron monarchy”. This beast has “huge iron teeth.” Just as the image of Daniel 2 has legs of iron which lead to feet of iron mixed with clay, the Roman Empire eventually became a divided kingdom of 10 nations represented by 10 horns. When the city of Rome fell to the barbarians in A.D. 476, the foundation for modern-day Europe was laid.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
But what is the meaning of the “little horn”? While the Bible does not specifically name this power, Daniel 7 gives several identifying marks for it.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, it begins small and rises up from among the ten horns, plucking out three of these powers. It rises out of the division of the Roman Empire.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, it has the eyes of a man and speaks pompous words against God. It is described as “different” from the other powers. It is more than a political power, it has a religious agenda.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third, it persecutes God’s people for a given period of time (a time and times and half a time), which in Bible prophecy equals 3 ½ prophetic years or 1260 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fourth, it intends to “change times and laws”. The most obvious example of “time” in God’s 10 commandment law would be the seventh-day Sabbath.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
So, we may identify this little horn power if we can determine what power grew out of the Roman Empire when it was divided, what power began small and grew strong, what power had a religious and political agenda, what power spoke against God and sought to change God’s law, and what power persecuted God’s people during a period of 1,260 years (from approximately A.D. 538 to 1798). What religious power might this be?</article>

    <Image1Desc>A lion with eagle’s wings is an appropriate symbol for Babylon. The winged lion is found on Babylonian objects of art. The combination of lion and eagle was a common motif—more often a lion with eagle’s wings, sometimes with claws or a beak a similar composite was the eagle with a lion’s head. The winged lion is one of the forms of the beast often pictured in combat with Marduk, the patron god of the city of Babylon.</Image1Desc>

    <shortdescription>Daniel is taken captive with other prisoners by Nebuchadnezzar when Jerusalem falls into the hands of Babylon.</shortdescription>
    <article>On the basis of Biblical synchronisms that correlate the reigns of several kings of Judah with that of Nebuchadnezzar, whose Babylonian regnal years have been astronomically established, Jehoiakim’s 3d regnal year lasted, by the Jewish calendar, from the autumn of 606 to the autumn of 605 b.c. Hence the events recorded in this and the following verse (Daniel 1:1) must have taken place sometime during the Jewish civil year that began in the fall of 606 and ended in the fall of 605 b.c. Before the ancient systems of regnal reckonings were understood, this verse presented commentators with a seemingly insuperable problem because of the apparent contradiction with Jer. 25:1. As a result of modern archeological discoveries all historical and chronological difficulties on this point have vanished, and the evidence provides a completely harmonious pattern. The integrity of the Sacred Record has once more been vindicated.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Nebuchadnezzar’s presence in Palestine in the early summer of 605 b.c., as Dan. 1:1 indicates, is confirmed by two Babylonian accounts: (1) a narrative by the historian Berosus, whose lost work has been quoted on this event by Josephus in his Against Apion (1.19) and (2) a portion of a hitherto unknown Babylonian chronicle (D. J. Wiseman, editor, Chronicles of Chaldaean Kings, 1956), which covers the entire reign of Nabopolassar and the first eleven years of his son Nebuchadnezzar.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Berosus, as Josephus quotes him, relates that Nebuchadnezzar was ordered by his father Nabopolassar to quench a rebellion in Egypt, Phoenicia, and Coele-Syria. Having completed his mission but still being in the west, he received word of his father’s death. Leaving the captives—among whom Jews are mentioned—in the hands of his generals, he hurried back to Babylon by the short desert route as quickly as possible. This haste was doubtless due to a desire to prevent any usurper from taking the throne. Berosus says that Nebuchadnezzar left Jewish captives with his generals when he hurriedly returned to Babylon. Daniel and his friends must have been among these captives. The statement of Dan. 1:1, 2 and that of Berosus were the only known ancient records that spoke of this campaign of Nebuchadnezzar until the discovery of this chronicle, a year-by-year account yielding for the first time exact dates for the accession and death of Nabopolassar, the accession of Nebuchadnezzar, and the capture of a king of Judah, obviously Jehoiachin, eight years later (it also places the death of Josiah in 609 and the battle of Carchemish in 605).</article>

    <shortdescription>The first beast coming out of the sea in Daniel's vision is a lion with wings and represents the kingdom of Babylon. It is a carnivorous animal mixture of lion and eagle. It is given the heart of the man, perhaps showing Nebuchadnezzar's humility.</shortdescription>
    <article>A lion with eagle’s wings is an appropriate symbol for Babylon. The winged lion is found on Babylonian objects of art. The combination of lion and eagle was a common motif—more often a lion with eagle’s wings, sometimes with claws or a beak a similar composite was the eagle with a lion’s head. The winged lion is one of the forms of the beast often pictured in combat with Marduk, the patron god of the city of Babylon.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Other prophets referred to King Nebuchadnezzar by similar figures (Jer. 4:7 Jer. 50:17, 44 Lam. 4:19 Eze. 17:3, 12 Hab. 1:8). The lion as the king of beasts and the eagle as the king of birds fittingly represented the empire of Babylon at the height of its glory. A lion is noted for its strength, whereas the eagle is famous for the power and the range of its flight. Nebuchadnezzar’s power was felt not only in Babylon but from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf, and from Asia Minor to Egypt. Thus it is fitting, in order to represent the spread of Babylon’s power, that the lion should be provided with eagle’s wings.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When its wings were plucked, the lion was no longer able to fly like an eagle upon its prey. This doubtless refers to the time when less powerful rulers followed Nebuchadnezzar in the kingdom of Babylon, rulers under whose administration Babylon lost glory and power. Some have suggested a possible reference also to Nebuchadnezzar’s later life, when for seven years he was deprived not only of his power but also of his reason (ch. 4:31–33).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The reference to a lion standing erect like a man is indicative of the loss of lionlike qualities. And speaking of having "a man's heart reminds us of King Richard’s nickname, the “Lion-Hearted,” ascribed to him unusual courage and boldness. Conversely, a “man-hearted” lion would indicate cowardice and timidity. In its declining years Babylon became weak and enfeebled through wealth and luxury, and fell a prey to the Medo-Persian kingdom. Some see in the expression “man’s heart” the disappearance of the animal characteristic of greed and ferocity and the humanizing of the king of Babylon. Such could apply to Nebuchadnezzar after his humiliating experience, but would not be a fitting representation of the kingdom in its closing years.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name possibly means "the holder." Darius "the Mede" is the son of Ahasuerus, and probably ruled over Babylon when it was "taken" by Cyrus, king of the Medo-Persian empire. This the king who is tricked into throwing Daniel into the lion's den.</shortdescription>
    <article>Darius the Mede, son of Ahasuerus, unknown by that name except in Daniel. He "took the kingdom" from Belshazzar at about the age of 62 years at the time of Cyrus’ conquest of Babylon (539 b.c.), and had at least one regnal year (Dan 5:31 6:28 9:1). He appointed various governors, making Daniel one of his three most intimate counselors (ch 6:1–3). Tricked by Daniel’s enemies into issuing a decree which the Hebrew statesman could not obey, he was forced to throw his friend Daniel to the lions, and was exceedingly happy when Daniel was miraculously saved (vs 4–27).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Various modern attempts to identify this Darius have resulted in several theories, none of them free from difficulties. One theory equates him with Cambyses, Cyrus’ son and successor, who ruled jointly with his father for a time another equates him with Gobryas, the officer of Cyrus who actually took the city of Babylon, and may have ruled the conquered Babylonian kingdom under Cyrus for a year or so. Another explanation, plausible enough, is that Darius is another name for Cyaxares II, the son of Astyages, who according to the Greek writer Xenophon was Cyrus’ uncle and father-in-law, and whom Cyrus might have retained temporarily as a figurehead king to please the Medes. The fact that the Persian account of the fall of Babylon to Cyrus begins Cyrus’ reign in Babylon immediately, without any intervening reign of Darius the Mede, does not contradict the Biblical narrative. Darius was evidently recognized as a ruler in Babylon by courtesy of Cyrus, while it was Cyrus who actually held the power (see Is 45:1). It was natural that Daniel, in direct contact with Darius, should speak of him as the "king" and mention his "first year" (Dan 9:1). It seems evident that we are to consider the accession year and 1st year of Darius the Mede as coinciding with the same years of Cyrus. For full discussion of this Darius. The lack of conclusive evidence as to the identity of Darius the Mede must not lead one to question the Bible statements concerning this ruler, for future finds may clarify the problem, as archeology has already done for Belshazzar, who puzzled earlier historians.</article>

    <shortdescription>Cyrus is the founder of the Persian empire and one of the greatest and most benevolent rulers of all time. He brings the Babylonian empire to an end and permits the Jews to return home and rebuild the Temple, and so fulfills prophecy.</shortdescription>
    <article>Cyrus. King and founder of the Persian Empire son of Cambyses I. He became king of Anshan in 558 b.c., ruling over Persian tribes as a vassal prince of the Medes. Greek historians name Mandane, the daughter of Astyages, king of Media, as his mother. After c. 559 b.c. he united the various Persian tribes into one nation, and between 553 and 550 b.c. defeated his grandfather Astyages and took over the Median Empire with its capital, Ecbatana. A few years later, in 547, b.c., he defeated Croesus, king of Lydia, and conquered Sardis, the "impregnable" Lydian capital. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
He thus became ruler of all of Asia Minor in addition to Iran (Persia) and the territories lying north of Mesopotamia that he already possessed. Since he was now the most powerful ruler of his time, a clash with the weakened Chaldean empire of Nabonidus was inevitable. In 539 b.c. the forces of Cyrus crossed the "Median wall" erected by Nebuchadnezzar, defeated the Babylonians in the battle of Opis on the Tigris, and shortly afterward captured Sippar and Babylon, the latter city falling without a real battle. Belshazzar, who had ruled in Babylon as coregent, was slain. His father, Nabonidus, fled, but later surrendered to Cyrus and was sent into exile. By bringing to an end the Babylonian Empire and by allowing the exiled Jews to return to their homeland and to rebuild their Temple at Jerusalem (2 Chr 36:22, 23 Ezr 1:1–4 6:3–5), Cyrus fulfilled the prophecies of Isaiah (Is 44:28 to Is 45:4).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Jews were not the only beneficiaries of Cyrus’ favors. From the long cuneiform inscription on the famous Cyrus Cylinder (now in the British Museum), we learn that he allowed various other nations exiled by the Babylonians to return to their homelands and to rebuild devastated sanctuaries. He also returned to their former temples cult objects, such as statues of divinities, in the same manner as he returned to the Jews the sacred vessels that Nebuchadnezzar had carried to Babylon from the Jerusalem Temple. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When he died in a campaign against some tribes in eastern Iran, in 530 b.c., the world lost one of its greatest monarchs. He had been not only a great warrior but also a wise organizer and a tolerant and broad-minded ruler. His empire, reaching from the Aegean Sea in the west to India in the east, and from the Caucasus Mountains in the north to the border of Egypt in the south, was the largest the world had ever seen. His son Cambyses, who followed him on the throne, added Egypt to the empire, which Cyrus himself may have planned. &lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "Merodach's man." Also called Amel-Marduk, he is the son and successor of Nebuchadnezzar. He rules for two years. He shows kindness to Jehoiachin of Judah who is released from captivity. Amel-Marduk is murdered by his brother-in-law.</shortdescription>
    <article>Evil-merodach, name means "man of (the god) Marduk." The son and successor of Nebuchadnezzar on the throne of Babylon. He ruled for two years (562–560 b.c.). According to the Babylonian historian Berossus, his reign was "arbitrary and licentious" (Jos. Against Apion i. 20, Loeb ed.). The Bible mentions Evil-merodach as showing kindness to King Jehoiachin of Judah, whom he released from prison in the 37th year of his captivity and placed in a more favorable position than that of any other exiled monarch living in Babylon (2 Ki 25:27–30 Jer 52:31–34). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The expressions used in both texts are ambiguous as to whether Jehoiachin’s release occurred in Amel-Marduk’s accession year or in his first regnal year. Amel-Marduk fell victim to a murderous plot of his brother—in—law, Nergal-shar-usur (Neriglissar), who succeeded him on the throne.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "I have asked God." He is listed in Matthew's genealogy as the son of Jeconiah (Jehoiachin) of Judah, but as the son of Neri in Luke's genealogy. Perhaps one of Jeconiah's descendents died childless and Neri married the widow.</shortdescription>
    <article>Shealtiel, name means "I have asked God." Son of Jeconiah (Jehoiachin) of Judah (Mt 1:12), and father of Zerubbabel (Ezr 3:2, 8 5:2 Neh 12:1 Hag 1:1, 12, 14 2:2, 23). But Lk 3:27 says that Shealtiel was the son of Neri, of the line of David through Nathan. This apparent discrepancy has been explained by assuming that one of Jeconiah’s descendants, perhaps a son, died childless, and that Neri married the widow and Shealtiel was born to this union. Neri would thus be the blood father (Lk), but Jeconiah a legal ancestor (Mt).</article>

    <shortdescription>Nebuchadnezzar besieges Jerusalem and takes Jehoiachin captive. At that time he takes all the treasures from the house of the Lord. He also takes many talented captives leaving only the poorest in the land.</shortdescription>
    <article>Nebuchadnezzar began his next campaign against Judah in the month of Kislev (Dec. 598-Jan. 597 b.c.), according to the Babylonian Chronicle. This was Nebuchadnezzar’s second attack on Jerusalem. The first was in 605 b.c., the third year of Jehoiakim (Dan. 1:1). In despair Jehoiachin surrendered. The date according to the Babylonian Chronicle was Adar 2, year 7 of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign in the Babylonian calendar (approximately March 16, 597 b.c.). The reference to the 8th year is the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar, following Jewish reckoning, according to which it had begun in the autumn of 598 b.c. It was still the 7th year according to Babylonian reckoning.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Some of the vessels of the Temple had already been taken to Babylon in 605, in Nebuchadnezzar’s first attack on Jerusalem (Dan. 1:2 2 Chron. 36:7). No doubt the most valuable vessels that remained after the initial looting were now carried away. Some vessels were still allowed to remain (2 Kings 25:13–16 Jer. 27:18–20). Concerning the number of vessels taken to Babylon see Ezra 1:7–11. Isaiah had made such a prediction at the time of the visit of the Babylonian envoys to Hezekiah (2 Kings 20:17 Isa. 39:6). When speaking of those who were carried away (all Jerusalem) it speaks of the upper classes. By "good figs" (Jer. 24:1–7) Jeremiah symbolizes those who were carried away at this time. The prophet Ezekiel was among those carried away into Babylon. The years of his book are counted from the time of Jehoiachin’s captivity (Eze. 1:1–3), 597 b.c. Taking away from Jerusalem its skilled workers would deprive the conquered city of that class of citizens who would be of most service in war, and would provide the conqueror with valuable helpers for his own extensive building enterprises.</article>

    <shortdescription>Ezekiel, a priest from Judah, is taken captive to Babylon, along with Jehoiachin and many others when he is about 25 years old.</shortdescription>
    <article>With the characteristic accuracy of a faithful historian, Ezekiel begins his prophetic dissertation (Ezekiel 1:1) with a careful dating of the events concerned. It was the 30th year. However, he does not specify the particular event that marks the beginning of this period. Many believe that he refers to the 30th year of his life. The age of 30 was significant from the point of view that at this age the Hebrew youth were considered to have reached maturity. This was the year in which the Levites originally began their Temple functions (Num. 4:3). It was in or about their 30th year that both our Lord and John the Baptist began their public ministry (see on Matt. 3:1).&lt;BR /&gt;
Since this 30th year is equated with the 5th year of Jehoiachin’s captivity (see on Eze. 1:2), the 1st year of the 30 would be (according to two of the possible reckonings) a significant year, the 18th of Josiah for it was then the book of the law was discovered in the Temple (2 Kings 22:3–8). This event marked the beginning of a reformation that, if successfully followed up, would have done much to alter the future history of Judah. It is possible that Ezekiel had this important incident in mind when he designated the 30th year.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
He then speaks of the "fourth month." Numbered from the spring month Nisan, regardless of whether the calendar year was reckoned from spring or fall. The 4th month would begin in our June or July, 593 or 592. Ezekiel was in the midst of the region where the captives were settled. A vision came to him privately, and was later to be delivered publicly (ch. 3:1, 4).</article>

    <shortdescription>King Nebuchadnezzar has a golden image built and set up on the plain of Dura. It is large and he instructs all the people who come must bow down and worship the image. Daniel's three friends refuse to do so and are thrown into a fiery furnace.</shortdescription>
    <article>No date is given for the events of Daniel 3. The name of the king is the only indication as to when these events occurred. The LXX and Theodotion’s Greek translation date the events in Nebuchadnezzar’s 18th year. Some scholars regard this as an interpolation. They reason that the translators believed that the colossal statue was erected to mark the final capture of Jerusalem. However, that city was not destroyed in Nebuchadnezzar’s 18th year, but rather in his 19th (2 Kings 25:8–10). The date 580 b.c., long given in the margin of the KJV, is derived from Ussher’s chronology (see Vol. I, pp. 179, 195) and has no adequate historical basis. Some commentators have even placed the narrative in the period following Nebuchadnezzar’s madness described in ch. 4, but this position is untenable, as will be shown.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This much is certain, the events narrated in this chapter occurred later than those of the 2d chapter, because ch. 3:12, 30 refers to ch. 2:49. Further, a comparison of Nebuchadnezzar’s addresses of praise in ch. 3:28, 29 and ch. 4:34–37 indicates that the king’s madness was a later event. Secular history is of no help in dating this event, since extra-Biblical records of that time nowhere mention the incident. However, a court almanac written in the year 570/569 b.c. excludes that year from consideration as a possible date and makes it highly improbable that the event had taken place recently. This almanac gives a list of all the highest state officials in office during that year. Neither Daniel nor his three friends are mentioned. Since the event described in Dan. 3 resulted in a promotion of the three Hebrews, and since it is unlikely that they were removed from office soon after their promotion—at least all three of them—a considerable time may have elapsed between the experience narrated in ch. 3 and the date of the court almanac.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The influence of the dream of ch. 2 on the events of ch. 3 strongly suggests that the events of ch. 3 cannot be dated in the latter part of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign. Some have suggested the date 594/593, for the following reasons: This date coincides with the 4th year of Zedekiah, who in that year made a journey to Babylon (Jer. 51:59). It is possible that the journey was undertaken in reply to the summons of Nebuchadnezzar that all his governors and vassal "rulers of the provinces" (Dan. 3:2) appear in Babylon to give homage to the image the king had erected. Zedekiah, a weak and vacillating character, would hardly be expected to have religious scruples such as made it impossible for Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to obey the king’s command. However, the dating of this event in the time of Zedekiah is no more than a possibility.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Why Daniel is not mentioned in the narrative is a question that cannot be answered. Whether he was ill or absent on an important mission cannot be known. Some have conjectured that because of embarrassment at having rejected the message of the dream, the king arranged to have Daniel away on important business for the crown. However, of one thing we may be certain: had the test come to him, Daniel would have stood as loyal as his three companions.</article>

    <shortdescription>The Bible says in the 9th year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, in the 10th month, on the 10th day of the month which would be January 15, 588 B.C. a final siege was made against Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah that were left.</shortdescription>
    <article>The ninth year of Zedekiah, by Jewish fall-to-fall reckoning, was 589/88 b.c. The tenth month of the Jewish year corresponds roughly to our January. On the day the siege of Jerusalem began, the Lord revealed this fact to Ezekiel in Babylonia (Eze. 24:1–14). The tenth of the tenth month in 588 b.c. can be dated with reasonable accuracy to Jan. 15 by the Babylonian calendar, though the Jewish reckoning of this month may have differed.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Not only was Jerusalem besieged, but parts of the army were sent against "all the cities of Judah that were left" (Jer. 34:7). Siegeworks, including sloping ramparts of earth from which battering-rams could attack the upper and weaker portions of the walls, and movable towers, to bring the attackers on a level with the defenders on the city walls. For details of the terrible siege, see Jer. 37, 38, 39. By the fourth month a famine had become so severe that defense was no longer possible. Mothers ate their own children in the extremity, and the skin of the sufferers became black and parched (Lam. 2:11, 12, 19, 20 4:3–10 5:10). The Lord had warned His people that such terrible conditions would be the result of transgression (Lev. 26:29 Deut. 28:53–57 Jer. 14:12–16 15:2 27:8, 13 Eze. 4:16, 17 5:10, 12).</article>

    <shortdescription>Judah, the southern kingdom, falls to Nebuchadnezzar after a prolonged siege of 17 months leads to starvation. Zedekiah tries to escape but is captured and taken to Babylon.</shortdescription>
    <article>When Israel sinned the Lord allowed the Assyrians to bring judgments against them (Isa. 10:5, 6), and now He permitted the Chaldeans to bring judgment upon a people "more righteous" than themselves (Hab. 1:6–13). The Hebrews were not all carried to Babylon at one time. The earliest captivity probably took place in 605 b.c. (see on 2 Kings 24:1 cf. Dan. 1:1–6). Other captivities were in Nebuchadnezzar’s 7th year, 598 b.c. (Jer. 52:28), his 8th year, 597 b.c. (2 Kings 24:12–16), his 18th year, 587 b.c. (Jer. 52:29), his 19th year, 586 b.c. (2 Kings 25:7, 8, 11), and his 23d year, 582 b.c. (Jer. 52:30).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>The book of 2nd Kings says that eventually the Babylonian army broke through the walls of Jerusalem in their siege against the city.</shortdescription>
    <article>The Babylonian army eventually broke through the walls in their siege against Jerusalem. An entrance may have been gained through a breach in the city wall made by battering-rams. The men of war fled. The flight was probably made down the Tyropoeon Valley, past the pool of Siloam, which was by the king’s garden (Neh. 3:15), near the junction of the Hinnom and Kidron valleys. A second wall had been built to the south and southwest of the old wall for the protection of the pool of Siloam (see 2 Chron. 32:4, 5 Isa. 22:9–11), and it was probably between this wall and the old wall of Zion that the flight took place. This would lead down to the Kidron Valley and thence toward the Arabah and the Jordan. Nebuchadnezzar's army overtook the fleeing army. Zedekiah’s capture by the Babylonians had been foretold (Jer. 38:23 Eze. 12:13).</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "Bel, protect the king." He is the last king of Babylon, the son of Nabonidus. Belshazzar holds a banquet the night the Persians capture Babylon. As they drink from the Temple vessels, a hand appears and writes a message on a wall.</shortdescription>
    <article>Belshazzar, name means "Bel, protect the king". According to Dan 5:2, 30, 31 he is the last king of the Chaldeans. Belshazzar was long unknown outside of the Bible and Jewish or Christian writings based on Dan 5. All secular sources dealing with the end of the Babylonian Empire listed Nabonidus as the last king. The discoveries of the last hundred years, however, have identified Belshazzar. It is now known from numerous contemporary cuneiform documents that he was the eldest son of Nabonidus, that as early as 560 b.c., 4 years before his father came to the throne, he was already a high officer of the crown, and that Nabonidus in "the third year" (most probably his third regnal year, although other interpretations of the term third year are possible) "entrusted the kingship" to his eldest son (as coregent) and also placed the army at Babylon under his command. The elevation to the kingship took place when Nabonidus was about to conduct a military campaign against Tema in the interior of northern Arabia. After Tema was captured, Nabonidus rebuilt it, made it his residence city, and remained there for 10 years. During these years the official royal duties at Babylon were performed by Belshazzar. Among these was the official mourning for Nabonidus’ mother, who died during these years.&lt;BR /&gt;
Daniel’s statement calling Belshazzar "the king" has thus been completely vindicated. Confirmation that Belshazzar was a descendant of Nebuchadnezzar, as Dan 5:2 indicates, has not yet been found, but as a result of the studies of R. P. Dougherty it now seems plausible that Belshazzar’s mother was a daughter of the great king, and that Belshazzar was thus the grandson of Nebuchadnezzar. According to Semitic usage "father" stood frequently for "grandfather" or "ancestor."&lt;BR /&gt;
Dan 5 describes the banquet Belshazzar held the night the Persians captured Babylon. It states that at the time the king drank wine from the sacred vessels of the Jerusalem Temple, his doom was spelled out in a mysterious handwriting on the plastered wall of his banquet hall, also how Daniel interpreted this message, and how it found its fulfillment before dawn came. Xenophon, too, intimates that the king met his death during the capture of Babylon (Cyropaedia vii. 5. 30).</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "offspring of Babylon." He is the son of Pedaiah and grandson of Jehoiachin King of Judah. Along with Jeshua he helps lead 50,000 Jews from Babylon back to their homeland. He helps rebuild the Temple and begins daily sacrifices again.</shortdescription>
    <article>Zerubbabel, name means "offspring of Babylon". A son of Pedaiah and grandson of King Jehoiachin of Judah (1 Chr 3:17–19). In all other texts where his "father" is mentioned he is called a son of Shealtiel, who was Pedaiah’s brother (Ezr 3:2, 8 5:2 Neh 12:1 Hag 1:1, 12, 14 2:2, 23 Mt 1:12 Lk 3:27). This apparent discrepancy can best be solved by the assumption either (1) that one of the 2 brothers died childless, upon which his wife was taken by the remaining brother according to the law of levirate marriages (Deut 25:5–10), and Zerubbabel, the son of that union, bore the name of the 1st husband of the mother although the 2nd was his real father or (2) that at the real father’s death the boy was brought up by his uncle and was counted as the "son" of his foster father (for an example of an adoptive son see Ex 2:10 cf. Gen 48:5).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When after the conquest of Babylon in 539 b.c., Cyrus, king of Persia, adopted the policy of allowing nations deported by the Babylonians to return to their homelands, he granted this privilege also to the Jews, and appointed a certain Sheshbazzar, a prince of Judah, as governor over the province of Judah. To him he entrusted the vessels of Solomon’s Temple that Nebuchadnezzar had carried to Babylon, to be returned to Jerusalem (Ezr 1:8, 11 5:14). The fact that all other records tell us that Zerubbabel was the leader of the returning exiles has led some commentators to the conclusion that Sheshbazzar and Zerubbabel were two names borne by the same individual (Ezr 2:1 Neh 7:7 12:1).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Zerubbabel and Jeshua, the high priest, were the leaders of the large group of people—about 50,000—who returned from Babylon to their homeland. Ten other leaders aided them in their work (Ezr 2:1, 2, 64, 65 Neh 7:7, 66, 67). After arriving in Jerusalem, probably in the summer of 536 b.c., Zerubbabel and other leaders reinstituted the daily sacrificial service they set up the altar of burnt offering and celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles (Ezr 3:1–6). Having done this Zerubbabel began to make preparations for the rebuilding of the Temple and laid its foundations in the following spring (vs 7–13). However, various hostile acts on the part of Judah’s neighbors frustrated his efforts and halted the work until the 2nd year of Darius (520/19 b.c. ch 4:1–5, 24).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Zerubbabel was the first governor of postexilic Judah. He was appointed c. 537 b.c., and was still in office in 515 b.c., at the time of the Temple dedication (Zec 4:9, 10 cf. Ezr 6:15). Thus he held office for more than 20 years. It was fitting that the 1st postexilic ruler of the country and the rebuilder of the Temple should be a representative of the Davidic royal line, and one who also was in the direct line of ancestry of Jesus Christ (Mt 1:6, 12, 13 Lk 3:27, 31).</article>

    <shortdescription>Cambyses is the son of Cyrus I. He ruled the Persian empire from 530 BC to 522 BC, and expanded its territory to include Egypt.</shortdescription>
    <article>Cambyses 530–522 b.c., who is not mentioned in the Bible, followed his father on the throne. His major accomplishment was the conquest of Egypt 525 b.c.. He stayed in that country for 3 years and organized the Nile valley into a strong Persian satrapy. However, before he left for Egypt he had his brother Bardiya called Smerdis, by the Greeks slain for fear that he might usurp the throne during his absence, since Bardiya was much more popular than he. In 522 b.c., while Cambyses was still in Egypt, Gaumata, a Median Magian, claimed to be Bardiya Smerdis and usurped the throne. Cambyses hurried back to Persia, but died on the way home, either by his own hand or as the result of an accident. He left no heir.</article>

    <shortdescription>Nebuchadnezzar has a second dream about a great tree that is cut down. It represents himself and his work of building up Babylon. The king continues in pride and is humiliated. He becomes like an animal for 7 years.</shortdescription>
    <article>The narrative of events in ch. 4 is recorded in the form of a royal proclamation. Because they cannot find parallels to such publicly announced conversions, modern scholars declare such an edict historically absurd. But arguments from silence are never conclusive. On the other hand, royal conversion to a new religion or god is attested elsewhere. For example, King Amenhotep IV of Egypt forsook the polytheistic religion of his ancestors and of the nation and made strong efforts to introduce a new monotheistic religion into the realm. He built a new capital, changed his own name, closed the old temples, denounced the old gods, erected new temples to his god, and did everything in his power to promote the new religion. Furthermore, little is known of Nebuchadnezzar’s history from sources outside of the Bible. Hence it is impossible to verify all the events of the king’s reign from contemporary source material. In fact, there are no contemporary non-Biblical sources for Nebuchadnezzar’s destruction of Jerusalem, or even for his long campaign against Tyre, though the historicity of these events is not disputed. It is therefore not strange to find no reference in Babylonian records to the king’s mental illness. Such records naturally omit items dealing with the misfortunes of a national hero. The change in this chapter from the first to the third person and back again to the first person has been explained by assuming either that Daniel wrote the edict upon the king’s command or that as Nebuchadnezzar’s chief counselor Daniel added certain portions to the edict written by the king himself. The edict reflected the king’s feelings when his full mental powers had been restored. "The once proud monarch had become a humble child of God".&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Name means "festival." He is one of the 12 minor prophets in the Old Testament and wrote a book that bears his name. Haggai works with the Jews after their return from the Babylonian exile and inspires them to awake from spiritual drowsiness.</shortdescription>
    <article>Haggai, name means "one born on a feast day." The name occurs also on ancient Hebrew seals, an inscribed jar handle, and on ostraca. He is a prophet of the Restoration period used by God to inspire the returned exiles to complete the rebuilding of the Temple, and author of the book that bears his name. It has been inferred from Hag 2:3 that Haggai was now an old man who had seen the 1st Temple prior to its destruction in 586 b.c., and from vs 10–19 that he was a priest. Aside from the book that bears his name he is mentioned only in Ezr 5:1 6:14. He was a contemporary of the prophet Zechariah (Ezr 5:1 cf. Zec 1:1).</article>

    <shortdescription>Nebuchadnezzar has a dream after which he becomes insane for 7 years. Then he lifts his eyes to heaven and his understanding returns to him and he praises God.</shortdescription>
    <article>The king testified that at the end of my days, that is, the end of the "seven times," or seven years, predicted for the continuation of Nebuchadnezzar’s madness, he lifted up his eyes. It is significant to notice that the return of reason is said to have come to the king with his recognition of the true God. When the humbled king prayerfully looked up to heaven he was elevated from the condition of a brute beast to that of a being bearing the image of God. The one who for years had helplessly lain on the ground in his debasement was once more lifted up to the dignity of manhood which God has granted His creatures formed after His likeness. The essential feature of the miracle that occurred in Nebuchadnezzar’s case is still repeated—even if in a less spectacular manner—in the conversion of every sinner. Nebuchadnezzar "blessed the most High." It speaks well for the once proud king, that after his dreadful experience his first desire was to thank God, to praise Him as the everliving One, and to recognize the eternity of His rulership.</article>

    <shortdescription>In the 37th year of his captivity, Jehoiachin is released from prison and exonerated by Evil-Merodach, Nebuchadnezzar's son. He eats from the king's table and is given a daily allowance. He is treated kindly by the Babylonian king.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jehoiachin was released in the 37th year of his captivity, in the twelfth month, which is the end of the Babylonian year, in the spring, just before the new-year festivities. This would be a suitable time for the release of political prisoners. Evil-merodach, the Babylonian king, is also called Amel-Marduk in secular history. He was the son and successor of Nebuchadnezzar, and came to the throne early in October, 562 b.c., and reigned till August, 560 b.c. He gave Jehoiachin precedence over other captive kings who were also in Babylon. The king gave bread to Jehoiachin, that is, he received his support from the royal purse, as was the case with the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of the groves who ate "at Jezebel’s table" (1 Kings 18:19).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In speaking of continued support for the king of Judah, Several cuneiform tablets of 592 b.c., listing payments of rations of oil, barley, etc., to captives and skilled workmen in and around Babylon, include the name of Yaukin (Jehoiachin), king of Judah, and five of his sons. This shows he was still at liberty in 592 b.c. For some unknown reason he was later imprisoned, where he remained until Evil-merodach freed him. From that time on till his death Jehoiachin once more received his support from the royal purse, living in peace and comfort in the land of his captivity. The writer of Kings closes his book with a picture of a former king of Judah, after a long and wearisome captivity, closing his life in comparative comfort and honor. Under extreme affliction, the seed of David was at least not wholly cast off.</article>

    <shortdescription>Belshazzar, king of Babylon, holds a feast with great confidence that the Persian army could never break through and capture Babylon. He arrogantly brings the Temple vessels and drinks from them. But that night the kingdom falls.</shortdescription>
    <article>When Nabonidus was in Lebanon recuperating from an illness, just before setting out on a campaign against Tema in western Arabia, he summoned his eldest son (Belshazzar), and "entrusted the kingship to him". This was in "the third year." If this was the third regnal year, it was in the winter of 553/552. Some scholars think it was in the third year after the completion of a temple at Haran if so, Belshazzar’s appointment as coregent occurred two or three years later, but some time before Nabonidus’ seventh regnal year, in which Nabonidus was in Tema. From that time on Belshazzar controlled the affairs of Babylonia as his father’s coruler, while Nabonidus resided in Tema for many years. According to the "Verse Account of Nabonidus," Belshazzar held the "kingship." Daniel therefore made no mistake when he called Belshazzar "king," though critics formerly declared that Daniel here erred.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Belshazzar held a great feast. From vs. 28 and 30 it can be concluded that the feast took place during the night that Babylon fell to Cyrus’ forces. Xenophon preserved the tradition that at the time of Babylon’s fall "a certain festival had come round in Babylon, during which all Babylon was accustomed to drink and revel all night long" (Cyropaedia vii. 5. 15). It is inexplicable that Belshazzar should have made a feast immediately after the fall of Sippar, and only a few days after the lost battle at Opis (see Vol. III, p. 49). Apparently, he felt recklessly secure in his capital, protected by strong walls and a system of canals which could, in case of danger, put the surrounding country under water and so make it difficult for an invader to reach the city.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
During the feast a Mysterious Hand writes a message on the wall that Daniel is called to interpret. The message of doom happens that very night. Although Belshazzar is not mentioned in the cuneiform sources describing the fall of Babylon, Xenophon declares that "the impious king" of Babylon, whose name is not mentioned in the account, was slain when Cyrus’ army commander Gobryas entered the palace (Cyropaedia vii. 5. 30). Although it must be recognized that Xenophon’s narrative is not historically reliable in all details, many of his statements are based on fact. According to cuneiform sources Nabonidus was absent from Babylon at the time of its capture. When Nabonidus surrendered, Cyrus sent him to distant Carmania. Therefore the king who was slain during the capture of Babylon could have been none other than Belshazzar. For a summary of the history of Belshazzar see Additional Note at the end of this chapter.</article>

    <shortdescription>Prophet and author of the book named after him. Zechariah prophesied during the time of the reconstruction of Jerusalem.</shortdescription>
    <article>Zechariah "Yahweh has remembered."  A prophet, a son of Berechiah, and grandson of Iddo (Ezr 5:1 Zec 1:1) author of the book of Zechariah. His first recorded message was given in the 2d regnal year (520/519 b.c.) of Darius I (Zec 1:1). He was presumably born in Babylonia. Like Jeremiah and Ezekiel he was most likely prophet and priest at the same time. This is concluded from the fact that he belonged to the house of Iddo, and a leading priest named Iddo returned with Zerubbabel (Neh 12:1, 4). It is also possible that the Zechariah, 31, who was the head of the priestly house of Iddo in the days of the high priest Joiakim (v 16) was a descendant of the prophet Zechariah. The book of Zechariah contains messages directed to Zerubbabel, the political head of the nation, Joshua, the high priest, and to the people as a whole, but little information about the prophet himself. With the prophet Haggai, Zechariah was instrumental in stirring up the returned Jews to resume activity in restoring the Temple and to finish the building (Ezr 5:1, 2).</article>

According to cuneiform sources Nabonidus was absent from Babylon at the time of its capture. When Nabonidus surrendered, Cyrus sent him to distant Carmania. Therefore the king who was slain during the capture of Babylon could have been none other than Belshazzar.</article>

    <shortdescription>In Nebuchadnezzar's great dream of an image, the chest of silver represents the kingdom of Medo-Persia. It is referred to as inferior (silver vs. gold) to Babylon, probably speaking of its glorious city, not its strength or territorial size.</shortdescription>
    <article>As silver is inferior to gold, the Medo-Persian Empire was inferior to the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Some commentators have explained the term “inferior” as meaning “lower down in the image,” or “below.” The expression correctly means “downward,” “earthward,” but in this verse (2:39) Daniel is speaking, not of the relative position of metals, but of nations. As we contrast the two kingdoms, we find that though the latter covered more territory, it certainly was inferior in luxury and magnificence. The Median and Persian conquerors adopted the culture of the complex Babylonian civilization, for their own was far less developed.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This second kingdom of Daniel’s prophecy is sometimes called the Medo-Persian Empire, because it began as a combination of Media and Persia. It included the older Median Empire and the newer acquisitions of the Persian conqueror Cyrus. The second kingdom cannot be the Median Empire alone, as some contend, with Persia as the third. The Median Empire was contemporary with the Neo-Babylonian, not its successor. Media fell to Cyrus the Persian before Babylon did. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The fact that after Belshazzar’s death Darius the Mede “was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans” (ch. 9:1) does not mean that there was a separate Median Empire after the Babylonian and before the Persians took over (see Vol. III, pp. 48–56, 94–96). Darius the Mede ruled in Babylon by permission of the real conqueror, Cyrus, as Daniel obviously knew. The book of Daniel repeatedly refers to the nation that conquered Babylon, and that Darius represented, as that of “the Medes and Persians” (see on chs. 5:28 6:8, 28), and it pictures that dual empire elsewhere as a single beast (see on ch. 8:3, 4).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In 553 or 550 B.C. Cyrus, who had become king of Persia as a vassal of the Median Empire, defeated Astyages of Media. Thus the formerly subordinate Persians became the dominant power in what had been the Median Empire. Since the Persians were the ruling power from the time of Cyrus on, it is now generally referred to as the Persian Empire. But the older prestige of Media was reflected in the phrase “Medes and Persians” applied to the conquerors of Babylon in Daniel’s day and even later (Esther 1:19 etc.). The honorary position of Darius the Mede after the conquest of Babylon demonstrates Cyrus’ deference to the Medes even after he himself wielded the actual power.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Years before, under prophetic guidance, the prophet Isaiah had described the work of Cyrus (Isa. 45:1). This conqueror of Media soon defeated the neighboring tribes and ruled from Ararat in the north to southeastern Babylonia and the Persian Gulf in the south. To round out his empire, he defeated the rich Croesus of Lydia in 547 B.C. and took Babylon by strategy in 539 B.C. Cyrus recognized that the Lord had given him all these kingdoms (2 Chron. 36:23 Ezra 1:2).</article>

    <shortdescription>In Daniel's dream of animals coming out of the sea, the second is a bear raised up on one side with three ribs in its mouth. It represents the older Median and younger (and stronger) Persian side. Three ribs are three kingdoms subdued.</shortdescription>
    <article>The Persian, or Medo-Persian, Empire is represented as a bear and corresponds to the silver of the image (see on ch. 2:39). As silver is inferior to gold, so, in some respects at least, the bear is inferior to the lion. The bear is, nevertheless, cruel and rapacious, characteristics that are attributed to the Medes in Isa. 13:17, 18. The interpreter (v. 16) does not explain the lopsided bear of the vision. However, a comparison with ch. 8:3, 20 seems clearly to indicate that the kingdom was composed of two parts. Of the Medes and the Persians, the latter became the dominant power a few years before the dual empire conquered Babylon. Speaking of three ribs, these are not mentioned in the interpretation (vs. 17–27), but many commentators have considered them a symbol of the three principal powers that were conquered by the Medo-Persian Empire—Lydia, Babylon, and Egypt.</article>

    <Image1Desc>The bear represented the empire of Medo-Persia. The three ribs in its mouth stood for the three kingdoms this coalition defeated in its rise to power: Babylon, Lydia, and Egypt. It was "raised up on one side," which symbolized the Persian's eventual dominance over the Medes. </Image1Desc>

    <shortdescription>Daniel has a dream of a ram and a male goat. The ram is described as having two great horns, one is higher than the other. This represents the kingdom of Medo-Persia which is later conquered by Alexander the Great.</shortdescription>
    <article>Persian history begins with Cyrus the Great (c. 553–530 B.C.). Although four generations of his royal ancestors are known, no historical records or traditions about their rule have survived. Achaemenes, the great-great-grandfather of Cyrus, as well as an ancestor of Darius through a different line, was considered the founder of the dynasty. Consequently the Persian kings of the ancient empire period are referred to as Achaemenids. On the other hand, the Persian kings who ruled over large parts of the East from A.D. 208 to A.D. 641, are called Sassanians or Sassanids, names derived from that of their family.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Cyrus was tolerant of other religions, and favored especially people who had been subjugated by the Babylonians, restoring the temples and modes of worship of these people and allowing exiles to return to their homelands. Among those who profited by these favorable policies were the Jews, who received permission to return to Palestine and rebuild their Temple in Jerusalem (2 Chr 36:22, 23 Ezr 1:1–11 6:2–5). See Cyrus.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Cambyses (530–522 B.C.), who is not mentioned in the Bible, followed his father on the throne. Darius, a distant relative, then rose to claim the kingship (522–486 B.C.). He slew Bardiya the pretender after he had reigned only about 6 months. However, Darius had to fight several other claimants to the throne before he became the undisputed ruler of the Persian Empire. Once on the throne Darius I proved to be a strong monarch and a great organizer, who ruled over his vast empire with a benevolent and peaceful hand. During the early years of his reign the Jews, who had been hindered in rebuilding the Temple at Jerusalem after the time of Cyrus, finally completed this work without interference under an extremely favorable decree issued by Darius (Ezr 4:24 to 6:15). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Xerxes I (486–465 B.C.), the son of Darius I, was a weak ruler compared with his father, and suffered several heavy defeats in Greece, although he was successful in suppressing revolts in Egypt and Babylonia. He also partly destroyed Babylon after a 2nd uprising there against his rule. He thus had a part in fulfilling the prophecies concerning Babylon’s fate made long before by Isaiah and Jeremiah (see Is 13:17–22 Jer 50:9–16). In the Bible Xerxes is mentioned by the name of Ahasuerus.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Artaxerxes I (465–423 B.C.), Xerxes’ son, took the throne upon his father’s assassination. He was erratic like his father, and loved pleasure and power but mananged to rule for more than 4 decades, largely because of the fact that his brother-in-law, Megabyzos, suppressed an Egyptian rebellion for him, and kept the empire intact. However, Megabyzos himself once rebelled when the perfidy of the king became too much for him. Artaxerxes followed the policy of religious tolerance practiced by his predecessors. Under him Ezra, a scholarly Jew, returned to Jerusalem in 457 B.C. with authority to reorganize the judicial and civil service of the province of Judah according to the Mosaic law (Ezr 7:1, 6, 11–26). Also under him Nehemiah, another Jew, was made governor of Judah and was allowed to refortify Jerusalem (Neh 2:5–8).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Darius II (423–405/04 B.C.) came to the throne after a short interval, during which Xerxes II, possibly also Sogdianus, ruled briefly before being eliminated by force. Darius II is apparently the last Persian ruler mentioned in the Old Testament, being probably the “Darius the Persian” of Neh 12:22, from whose reign we have the last lists of Temple personnel given in the Bible.</article>

    <article>Daniel 11 is a fascinating but challenging chapter in Scripture to understand. Battles between powers are described, but ultimately God is ruler over all. In the end (12:4) Michael (Christ) stands up and puts an end to evil. The kingdom of Persia and Greece (11:2) are identified, and that the “mighty king” (v. 3) is a reference to Alexander the Great. After his death, Alexander’s empire was divided into four territories (v. 4). As battles unfold between the king of the South and the king of the North, history presents different kings from the Seleucid and Ptolemaic Empires (north and south of Palestine) who are at war. Then verses 21-39 present a blasphemous power who matches the character of the little horn in Daniel 7 and 8. And verses 40-45 appear to describe a conflict between two powers that wage war just before Christ returns.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Persia and Greece&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
The kingdoms of Persia and Greece are clearly identified in Daniel 11:2. Verse 3 says, “A mighty king shall arise, who shall rule with great dominion …” Not only does Alexander the Great fit this description, but the description of his kingdom being “broken up and divided toward the four winds” (v. 4) parallels Daniel 7:6 which describes Greece as a leopard with four wings and four heads. Alexander’s four generals eventually divided the empire which was later conquered by the next world empire, Rome. The interplay of powers between the Ptolemaic Empire (Egypt ruled by the Greek dynasty, king of the South) and the Seleucid Empire (Syria, king of the North) present battles around the Holy Land that included several kings from both sides. God’s people found themselves between these two factions.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;A Vile and Blasphemous Power&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Verse 21 says, “And in his place shall arise a vile person, to whom they will not give the honor of royalty; but he shall come in peaceably, and seize the kingdom by intrigue.” Though this vile person is not specifically referred to as “the king of the North” in Daniel 11, the characteristics match the description of the little horn power of Daniel 7 and 8. The Roman Empire was the next ruling world power according to Daniel 2:40. In Daniel 8:9 we see that Rome conquered the “Glorious Land” of Israel. So also Daniel 9:25, 26 identified this power as not only “cutting off” the Messiah, but destroying the city and sanctuary. All these happened under the rule of Imperial Rome.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Future Events&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Verse 45 is still in the future. “And he [king of the North] shall plant the tents of his palace between the seas and the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and no one will help him.” Daniel 11 contains parallels with other prophecies that describe these final evil powers coming to and end. Daniel 2:35 says, “Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed together, and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; the wind carried them away so that no trace of them was found …” We can know with assurance that as the last battles against God’s true remnant people takes place during the final events of Earth’s history that Michael, the great prince, will stand up. “And at that time your people shall be delivered, every one who is found written in the book” (Daniel 12:1).</article>

    <shortdescription>In the first year of Cyrus' rule as king of Persia he proclaims that the Jews may return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple. The articles from the Temple are also returned. Isaiah prophesied about Cyrus by name.</shortdescription>
    <article>The city of Babylon fell to Persian arms on Tishri 16 (Oct. 12), 539 b.c. (see p. 55), and Cyrus himself entered the city on Marcheshvan 3 (Oct. 29) of the same year. However, it was not until the next New Year’s Day, Nisan 1 (March 24), 538 b.c., that the first Babylonian regnal year began. All documents previous to this day were dated in his "accession year". The Jews, on the other hand, counted the regnal years of Persian rulers according to their own calendar. By the Jewish civil calendar the first full year from the fall of Babylon extended from the autumn of 538 to the autumn of 537 b.c.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The edict of Cyrus for the return of the Jews seems to have been issued in the former capital city of the Medes, Ecbatana (Achmetha), which became one of the summer residences of the Persian kings. A copy of the decree found in the archives of Ecbatana some years later (Ezra 6:2) implies that Cyrus was there sometime during his first year. Evidence from the contemporary archives of the banking firm of "Egibi &amp; Sons" in the city of Babylon indicates that Cyrus was in Ecbatana in or preceding the month of September, 537 b.c., which fell toward the close of the first full Jewish calendar year after the fall of Babylon.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Cyrus felt that he was an appointee of heaven, and that as such he had a divine commission to fulfill. In the famous inscription on the clay barrel of Cyrus, now in the British Museum, the king says, "He [the Babylonian god Marduk] scanned and looked [through] all the countries, searching for a righteous ruler willing to lead him [in the annual procession]. He pronounced the name of Cyrus, king of Anshan, declaring him to be the ruler of all the world." These words, written for the Babylonians, are so similar to those used in the proclamation on behalf of the Jews that they, in combination with the other typical official terms used, constitute strong proof of the authenticity of the decree. The only difference consists in the names of the gods. In Babylonian proclamations the name of the Babylonian god Marduk was naturally used, while in one written for the Jews the name of their God was employed.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Permission was granted the Jews to collect financial contributions from their heathen friends for the Temple to be built in Jerusalem. It is noteworthy that the public pronouncement of Cyrus’ decree contains this appeal to the citizens of the empire without mentioning the fact that Cyrus had made provision for the rebuilding of the Temple from public funds, as is stated in the copy of the decree deposited in the government archives at Ecbatana (see on ch. 6:2). The reason is obvious. Had the proclamation mentioned the royal subsidy, few people would have felt impressed to give to the enterprise themselves. Without knowing that the government was paying part of the cost, many heathen who were friendly disposed toward the Jews may have been more willing to make private contributions.</article>

    <shortdescription>The reconstruction of Jerusalem took more than 90 years. The first group of exiles started reconstructing the Temple in 536 BC, but only finished in 515 BC.The walls were not completed until the arrival of Nehemiah in 444 BC.</shortdescription>
    <article>After Jerusalem laid in ruins for about 50 years, the first large group of exiles returned from Babylon, led by Zerubbabel. This was probably in 536 BC, which was 70 years, inclusive, from the first deportation in 605 BC. Immediately they set out to rebuild the temple, but experienced so much opposition from the Samaritans, and other difficulties that this did not really get into full swing until the 2nd year of Darius I 520/519BC. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The temple was finally completed and dedicated in 515 BC, in the 6th year of Darius I. In the 7th year of Artaxerxes I, Ezra was authorized to take a 2nd group of exiles to Jerusalem. He reorganized the province and set up an administration based on Jewish law, in 457 BC. It was probably during the next years that the Jews of Jerusalem began again to rebuild their wall. However they were once again hindered by their enemies until Nehemiah succeeded in having himself appointed as governor by Artaxerxes I. He went to Jerusalem in 444 BC and completed the rebuilding and repair work in a few weeks in spite of many hindrances.</article>

    <shortdescription>After resistance to the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem stalls the work, an investigation is made by Darius who orders the construction to begin once more.</shortdescription>
    <article>Prophecy seems to have been silent for about 16 years, ever since the "third year of Cyrus," Daniel uttered his last message (Dan. 10:1). Now it was revived. Since we have the actual writings of the two prophets here mentioned, Haggai and Zechariah, we are well informed as to what they contributed by way of encouragement and guidance in the resumption of work on the Temple. It is evident from their words that the long delay in realizing the ardent hopes in regard to the rebuilding of the Temple had had an adverse effect on the spirit of the people. Experiencing opposition to their pious efforts to please God and to re-establish the Temple and its services, they allowed their enthusiasm to fade away. A selfish desire for comfort had taken the place of zeal for the honor of God.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Instead of watching for an opportunity to begin the work anew, and taking advantage of it, the people acquiesced in the indefinite postponement and said among themselves, "The time is not come, the time that the Lord’s house should be built" (Haggai 1:2). Laying aside the idea of pressing forward with the work, they had turned their energies to the practical object of establishing themselves in comfortable homes (Haggai 1:4, 9). The result of this complacency had been divine judgments, consisting of poor harvests, economic distress (Haggai 1:6, 1:9–11), and great political insecurity (Zech. 1:12 to 2:9). These conditions had not been recognized by the people as signs of God’s displeasure. Human agents were therefore raised up by God to interpret to the people the meaning of the circumstances in which they found themselves and to inspire them with new zeal.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The data given by Haggai reveal the successive stages that marked the resumption of building activity. The first call for action was sounded Aug. 29, 520 b.c. (Haggai 1:1). This appeal proved successful, for the leaders apparently began laying plans immediately, and actually set to work about three weeks later, Sept. 21, 520 b.c. (Haggai 1:15). When the site was cleared and the trenches were being dug for the new foundation, it again became apparent that the new Temple would not compare well in size and beauty with that of Solomon’s, and some expressions of disappointment were heard (Haggai 2:3, 9 cf. Ezra 3:12, 13). For this reason Haggai addressed another message of encouragement, this time to the people, on October 17 (Haggai 2:1). Two months later everything was ready for the laying of the foundation, and that great occasion, Dec. 18, 520 b.c. (Haggai 2:10, 18), was celebrated, in keeping with Oriental custom. On that day Haggai delivered two speeches, the last of which we have any record. In the meantime, two months after Haggai delivered his first recorded message, Zechariah joined him (Zech. 1:1). A study of the books of Haggai and Zechariah emphasizes the accuracy of the statement of Ezra 5:2, that "the prophets of God" were "helping them" in rebuilding the Temple. Their stirring messages of exhortation, instruction, and encouragement contributed much to the task in fact, except for their inspired ministry, the Temple might have continued to lie desolate.</article>

    <shortdescription>The son of Darius I, he is a weak ruler compared to his father and suffers heavy losses in Greece. He is known in the Bible by the name Ahasuerus and is king during the time of Queen Esther.</shortdescription>
    <article>Ahasuerus, a son and successor of Darius I on the Persian throne (486–465 b.c.), known in secular history as Xerxes. Shortly after taking the throne he successfully put down a serious rebellion in Egypt that had broken out before his father’s death. He also quenched a serious Babylonian revolt and largely destroyed the city of Babylon, especially its fortifications, palaces, and temples. His military campaigns against the Greeks, however, ended in failures, so that the battles at Salamis, Plataea, Mycale, and the Eurymedon are known for the defeats the Persians suffered. Yet Xerxes was not perturbed by these misfortunes, and lived the carefree life of an Oriental despot. The description of his character by contemporary historians agrees well with the impression one gains from reading the story of Esther, his queen (Est 2:16, 17). He was a weak character and was easily influenced by his courtiers and wives. Ezr 4:6 tells how the Samaritans attempted to influence "Ahasuerus," identified by many with Xerxes, against the Jews. Whether this effort succeeded or failed is not known.</article>

    <shortdescription>Through the help of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia, and through the governor Tattenai, and through the encouragement and prophesies of Haggai and Zechariah, the Temple in Jerusalem is rebuilt, about 70 years after its destruction.</shortdescription>
    <article>Having no enmity toward the Jews, as is evident from their former actions and their letter to Darius, Tatnai and his fellow officers revealed no reluctance in carrying out the royal command. The king’s will had been made known to them in unmistakable words, and they proceeded to carry it out with zeal. In part, the rapid completion of the Temple must be attributed to their good will. This must have required Tatnai and his retinue to visit Jerusalem again and make a survey of the financial needs of the Jews and the number of sacrificial animals considered necessary for the Temple service (see v. 9).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Jews, who had experienced so many troubles and disappointments during recent years, could have expected no greater or more joyful surprise than the message of Darius’ new decree. Suddenly were fulfilled the prophecies of Haggai, who had reminded them that their God was the owner of silver and gold, and that it would be easy for Him to supply the necessary means to complete the task they had begun in faith (Haggai 2:8). On the day when the new foundation had been laid, the Lord had promised, "From this day will I bless you" (Haggai 2:19). Marvelous was the fulfillment. In fact, the blessings in view must have exceeded their most daring hopes.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The exact day of the completion of the Temple is given, probably also the day of dedication described in vs. 16–18. Adar 3 in the 6th regnal year of Darius I was about March 12, 515 b.c., six weeks before the Passover. The rebuilding of the Temple from the time the foundation stone had been laid a second time (Kislev 24, 2nd year of Darius) to its completion, had therefore occupied about 4 years and 3 months, some 2 years and 3 months shorter than it had taken Solomon to build his Temple. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The reason for this difference probably lies in the fact that Solomon had first to prepare a flat surface on which to erect the various buildings belonging to the Temple complex, a task of no small size. Although the present substructures of the Temple area at Jerusalem date from Herodian times or later, as far as they are visible, they reveal the tremendous efforts that must have been made by the early builders to construct a foundation platform on which the Temple and its many auxiliary buildings could be erected. When the exiles returned they probably found that great parts of this substructure were still good enough to use without expensive, time-consuming repair work. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Furthermore, the buildings seem to have been less elaborate and numerous than in Solomon’s time, and probably much less lavishly decorated (see ch. 3:12). Also, a certain amount of building had been carried on since the time that the first decree was issued. Some or all of these reasons may have been responsible for the comparatively short period required to build the second Temple.</article>

    <shortdescription>Meaning of name unsure. A son of Jair of the tribe of Benjamin, he is best known in the book of Esther as a gatekeeper and counselor to King Ahasuerus. When he refuses to bow to Haman, the latter determines to destroy him and the Jews but Haman dies.</shortdescription>
    <article>Mordecai, a Benjamite, son or descendant of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish (Est 2:5). Mordecai is introduced as a gate official in the palace of Susa (vs 5, 21) who had brought up Hadassah, or Esther, his uncle’s daughter (v 7). When King Ahasuerus (Xerxes) deposed Queen Vashti, and a substitute was sought, Esther was chosen to fill the vacancy (vs 8–20). When Mordecai learned of a plot against the king’s life, he warned Ahasuerus through Esther, and the conspirators were executed (Est 2:21–23). For refusing to bow down to Haman, the prime minister, Mordecai incurred his enmity. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Some believe that Mordecai’s refusal was due to Haman’s possible descent from the former Amalekite kings. In retaliation Haman plotted to destroy not only him but also the whole Jewish nation, and obtained the king’s permission to carry out his plan (ch 3:1–15). When Mordecai learned of this he instructed Esther to speak to the king, which she promised to do after a period of fasting (ch 4:1–17). When Esther saw the king she invited him and Haman to a dinner, and at the dinner repeated the invitation for the following day, deferring presentation of her request until then (ch 5:1–8). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Returning home from his first dinner appointment with inflated feelings of the high honor that had been extended to him, Haman became furious when Mordecai, whom he met, refused to honor him. He immediately prepared a gallows, planning to impale Mordecai the next day (vs 9–14). That night the king, unable to sleep, for diversion had the official state chronicles read to him. Therein was found the account of a conspiracy against the king’s life which failed because Mordecai, having learned of the plot, informed the king. The king discovered that his faithful servant had not been rewarded. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Next morning he asked Haman what to do for a man whom he wished to honor. Thinking that he himself was meant, Haman suggested that the man should be dressed in royal garments and be paraded through the streets on the king’s horse. The king accepted the suggestion and ordered Haman himself so to honor Mordecai (ch 6:1–14). During the 2n d dinner Esther revealed to the king Haman’s plot to wipe out her nation, and received a favorable decision from him. Haman was executed and Mordecai put in his place, and a decree was signed allowing the Jews to avenge themselves upon those who would destroy them (chs 7:1 to 9:16).</article>

    <article>Ezra, name means "Yahweh has helped," a priestly descendant of Zadok, of the house of Phinehas (Ezr 7:1–16), probable author of the canonical book of Ezra. He was commissioned by a decree of the Persian king Artaxerxes issued in his 7th year, to journey to Jerusalem, to set up civil and religious administration, and to take whatever measures might be found necessary for the welfare of Jerusalem and its inhabitants (vs 6–26). He was "a ready scribe in the law of Moses" (v 6), and thus a well-educated Jew of the priestly class. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jewish tradition identifies him as the first of the order of "scribes," who, in the days of Christ, were the official interpreters of the Jewish law. With the royal decree in his hand and accompanied by a 2nd band of Jewish exiles numbering more than 1,700 men, Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the 5th month (v 8), approximately in August. (This would be August, 457 b.c., if the 7th year of the reign is to be reckoned according to the Jewish fall-to-fall civil year beginning half a year later than the Persian year, which ran from spring to spring.) &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Finding the Jews of Palestine lax in observing the requirements of the Law, he instituted a thoroughgoing series of reforms. Many of the priests and others who had married heathen wives were persuaded to divorce them (chs 9 10). Under the governorship of Nehemiah some 13 years later, Ezra led in the public reading and exposition of the Law (Neh 8), and had a leading role in the dedication of the new city wall (Neh 12:36) after its rebuilding under the leadership of Nehemiah.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means in Persian "star." Her original name was Hadassah ("myrtle"). She is taken into the family of Mordecai when her parents die. She becomes queen to Ahasuerus and also a savior of the Jews when Haman determines to kill them.</shortdescription>
    <article>Esther, meaning of name thought to come from a Persian word meaning "star." The Jewish queen of King Ahasuerus, or Xerxes, and heroine of the book of Esther. Her original Hebrew name was Hadassah, "myrtle." She probably adopted the Persian name Esther upon entering the Persian court. Esther was the daughter of Abihail, apparently a Benjamite, and the adopted daughter of her cousin Mordecai, a courtier of Ahasuerus (Est 2:5, 7, 15). Both Esther and Mordecai were descendants of the Hebrew exiles who had been transported to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar more than 100 years earlier, but were among those who had chosen to remain in the land of exile when Cyrus granted permission for the return to Judea. Both were residents of Susa (Shushan), formerly capital of Elam, but in their time one of several Persian capitals, situated about 200 mi. (320 km.) east of Babylon.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Esther was a remarkably beautiful young woman whose tact and winsomeness brought her into royal favor and earned for her the title of queen after the former queen, Vashti, fell into disfavor. Ahasuerus gave her this rank in his 7th year, about the month of January, 478 b.c. this would have been at some time soon after the disastrous war in Greece marked by the battles of Salamis and Plataea. Four years later, in April, 474 b.c. the royal favorite, Haman, cast lots and then secured a royal decree authorizing the slaying of all Jews within the borders of the Persian Empire and the confiscation of their property (Est 3:7–15). By this decree he sought revenge upon Mordecai, who, as he came and went at the palace gate, had consistently refused to prostrate himself before Haman (vs 2–6). The decree naturally threw the Jews into great consternation, and Mordecai reported the matter to Esther (ch 4:1–7) with the admonition that God had providentially overruled that she should be queen at this hour of crisis (vs 8–17). In a supreme act of bravery equaled only by her infinite tact, Esther appealed to the king on behalf of her people, apparently for the first time revealing that she herself was Jewish (chs 6 and 7). Upon Haman’s execution, the king elevated Mordecai to Haman’s former position, and in the month of June signed a decree prepared by Mordecai that, in effect, reversed Haman’s decree (Est 8:1). In joyful celebration of their miraculous deliverance the Jews declared a festal period known as Purim, "Lots," in commemoration of Haman’s casting of lots in connection with the decree for slaying the Jews (chs 3:7 9:17–32). Ever since, the Jews have celebrated this festival in honor of Esther and in commemoration of her spirit of bravery and devotion, which God used as the means of bringing deliverance to His people.</article>

    <shortdescription>Three Persian kings are known by this name, but only Artaxerxes I is spoken of in the Bible. He sends Ezra to Jerusalem with generous support to rebuild the Temple and later his cupbearer, Nehemiah, to help rebuild the walls and be governor.</shortdescription>
    <article>Artaxerxes, known as Artaxerxes I Longimanus (465–423 b.c.), king of Persia, 3rd son and successor of Xerxes. Three kings bore the name Artaxerxes in Persian history, but only the 1st is mentioned in Biblical history. Like his father, he was a weak ruler, easily influenced by courtiers and women, and spent most of his life in his various palace cities while the empire was ruled by trusted friends and relatives, and his military campaigns were carried out by his generals. According to Ezr 4:7–23, Artaxerxes once prohibited the rebuilding of Jerusalem. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
According to ch 7, Artaxerxes in his 7th regnal year (457 b.c. according to the Jewish civil year running 6 months later than the Persian) sent the Jewish scribe Ezra back to Jerusalem with extensive privileges to reorganize Judah’s judicial and administrative structure as a Jewish state within the Persian Empire—in harmony with the Laws of Moses. Ezra also received generous financial support from the king, and a permit to lead back to Palestine all Jews who desired to return to their homeland. Several thousand exiles made use of this opportunity. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Artaxerxes later appointed his Jewish cupbearer, Nehemiah, as governor of the province of Judah, and sent him to Jerusalem to complete the city wall, the rebuilding of which had run into difficulties because of the antagonism of Judah’s neighboring nations (Neh. 1 2). This permit was given in the 20th year of Artaxerxes (444 b.c. by the same Jewish calendar). After Nehemiah had served as governor of Judea for 12 years he was recalled to the Persian court but later was allowed to serve a second term (chs 5:14 13:6, 7).</article>

    <shortdescription>King Ahasuerus makes a great feast for his officials. On the last day of the feast he calls for Queen Vashti to come before his officials that he might show off her beauty. She refuses to come and he becomes angry and takes her from the throne.</shortdescription>
    <article>Having displayed the wealth and glory of his kingdom, Ahasuerus’ thoughts finally turned to his beautiful queen. The display of her beauty would, he thought, climax the exhibition of the great banquet he held. But Vashti refused to come. The reason for the queen’s refusal is not clear. Some have suggested that Ahasuerus intended an immodest display of Vashti’s beauty, but the context provides no clue as to whether this was his purpose. The Jewish targums, however, assume that her motive for refusing to appear was her desire to avoid such a display, Josephus attributes her refusal to what he, mistakenly, thought to be a Persian custom, one that presumably prohibited married women from associating with strangers. Other ancient Jewish writers set forth a variety of imaginary or preposterous explanations, none of which warrant serious consideration.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Ahasuerus’ order specifying that Vashti wear the royal crown (v. 11) implies that he was thinking of her, not merely as a beautiful woman, but also as the first woman of the land. That it was actually good taste for Persian women to appear at the banquet table with strangers is evident from Esther 5:4. Chaldean wives and concubines also joined their husbands in drunken feasting (Dan. 5:2). According to Neh. 2:1–6 the queen of Ahasuerus’ son and successor, Artaxerxes I, accompanied her lord at wine. Several Greek writers confirm the presence of Persian women at feasts. Herodotus, a contemporary of Ahasuerus, speaks of Amestris (see on Esther 1:9) at the king’s birthday feast (ix. 110). There is no reason for thinking that contemporary Persian custom secluded women, and that it would therefore have been improper for Vashti to appear when summoned, in spite of the fact that the men were drinking (see ch. 7:7).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The fact that Vashti held a banquet for the women of Shushan simultaneously with that of Ahasuerus for the men implies cooperation with his policy in promoting popular loyalty to the throne. Nothing in the record gives a clue to the reason for Vashti’s refusal to obey the king’s command. Angry as he is, Ahasuerus seeks counsel. In the presence of his whole court it would be unseemly for him to vent his passion in violent words and threats. Instead of issuing a hasty order, he proceeds deliberately to consider what steps should be taken. Ahasuerus seems to have relied heavily on his counselors (see chs. 3:8–10 8:1–8 9:12–14), and now invites the opinion of his "wise men" as to how to deal with Vashti.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Vashti was to be banished, not from the palace, but from the king’s presence. This, together with the loss of her favored position as queen, would bring supreme disgrace. Beauty alone could not save her (see v. 12). Vashti was separated, but not divorced, from the king. The grounds for this action were published throughout the provinces, so that none might misunderstand. Ahasuerus’ care in handling the case suggests the idea that Vashti may have been the daughter of a prominent Persian whose support the king sought to retain, or perhaps the daughter of the prince of one of his subject peoples.</article>

    <shortdescription>When Mordecai refuses to bow to Haman, he becomes angry and plots to kill him and all the Jews. He gets King Ahasuerus to sign a decree that on a specific day anyone can kill the Jews.</shortdescription>
    <article>When Haman is promoted by the king, everyone bows to him, except Mordecai. In view of the fact that the Hebrew people prostrated themselves not only before kings (1 Sam. 24:8) but before superiors in general, or those whom they wished to honor as such (Gen. 23:7 27:29 33:3 etc.), Mordecai’s motive in refusing to bow to Haman is not entirely clear. Haman was, to be sure, a Gentile but Abraham bowed to Gentiles (Gen. 23:7). Mordecai did refuse Haman reverence that belongs only to God. The persistent attempt made to secure Mordecai’s compliance with the edict to bow before Haman implies that his fellow officials esteemed him highly. They sought to give him a fair opportunity before reporting the matter. From their point of view it was a serious precedent—if one royal decree could thus be flouted, how about others?&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Mordecai probably explained that his religion made it impossible to worship any man. Apparently, Mordecai’s race had not been suspected. In appearance and language he and Esther both seem to have passed as Persians. Mordecai’s disrespect apparently came to Haman’s attention only through the "king’s servants." Mordecai’s attitude and explanation meant that Jews everywhere stood opposed to Haman. Mordecai’s apparent defiance, boldly displayed at the very gate of the palace, could mean but one thing to Haman—conspiracy! At least, Haman was pleased to interpret it so. And if Mordecai justified his course on a religious basis, all who held that religion must therefore be involved also. If Haman had simply informed Xerxes that one of the minor court officials was insulting him and thereby disobeying a royal edict, Ahasuerus would certainly have ordered Mordecai put to death. But Mordecai, as a Jew, had insulted him, and therefore the Jews as a nation should be punished. If the Jews and their religion stood in the way of Haman’s pride and security, both must be sacrificed.</article>

    <shortdescription>After much fasting, Queen Esther approaches the king and uncovers Haman's plot to destroy the Jews. Mordecai is honored and Haman is hanged. The Jews are given permission to defend themselves.</shortdescription>
    <article>When a criminal was executed all his property was forfeited to the king, who disposed of it according to his pleasure. It pleased Ahasuerus to bestow upon Esther all the possessions of Haman, who seems to have been a man of vast wealth (see on ch. 3:9). Mordecai was appointed to the position that had been Haman’s. He was made grand vizier, or prime minister—a high official who ministered to the king personally and was in constant attendance upon him. The possessions of Haman had been forfeited to the crown and assigned to the custody of Esther (see on v. 1). She was not at liberty to give away what she had received in trust from the king and held by virtue of her position as queen. Thus Esther did not make Mordecai a gift of the house but set him over it. For all practical purposes this was equivalent to a gift. He was thus provided with a residence suitable to his new dignity as prime minister.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Though Mordecai was in possession of the royal signet, he would not dare to use it to give authority to a new decree that would countermand one already issued by the king personally. So Esther once more approached the king. The king probably extended his scepter on this occasion not only as a token of favor toward Esther and of willingness to give her an audience but also as an indication of willingness to do as Esther desired and thereby undo the evil effected by the decree of Haman. In her petition Esther unites an appeal to the king’s sense of right and justice with an even more effective appeal to his regard for her personally. He would not refuse her request.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Ahasuerus proposes a solution, after first reminding Esther and Mordecai of evidence of his favorable attitude toward the Jews. The new decree was to be addressed to the Jews rather than to the Persians, as was that of Haman. In deference to the Persian legal custom by which a royal edict was unalterable, Mordecai successfully devised a means of counteracting the effects of Haman’s decree without actually revoking it. The resulting decree was published in every language, copies being made by the royal stenographers (see ch. 3:12). Cooperative effort on the part of the Jews would make of them a formidable force. The Jews have sometimes been spoken of as aggressors on the 13th of Adar, but of this there is no evidence. The edict clearly allowed them to stand only on the defensive.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "Yahweh has comforted." Son of Hachaliah or Hacaliah, he is a Jew of the postexilic period and appointed governor of Judea by Artaxerxes. As cupbearer to the king he requests to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem which he does.</shortdescription>
    <article>Nehemiah, name means "Yahweh has comforted." He was a Jew of the postexilic period and son of Hachaliah (Neh 1:1). He was appointed governor of Judea by Artaxerxes I, king of Persia, and distinguished himself as the rebuilder of the city wall of Jerusalem. When first mentioned Nehemiah was serving as a trusted officer at the court of Artaxerxes I, king of Persia, in the 20th year of Artaxerxes’ reign (vs 1, 11), or 445/44 b.c. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
A serious rebellion in Egypt, and more recently a rebellion in the satrapy Beyond the River, to which Judea belonged, had interrupted communications between Susa (Shushan), the Persian capital, and Palestine. Finally a report reached Nehemiah that his countrymen in Jerusalem suffered "great affliction and reproach" and that the city wall had been broken down and the gates burned (vs 1–3). Mourning and fasting for a period of time, Nehemiah was questioned by the king as to the reason for his sad countenance (chs 1:4 to 2:3). Nehemiah took this opportunity to appeal to the king on behalf of his people and, at his request, received a commission to return to Jerusalem for a specified period of time in order to bring his people whatever help they should require (ch 2:4–6). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Supplied with a royal letter of introduction to the necessary officials authorizing his mission and empowering him to requisition materials necessary for the restoration of the wall, the fortress, and the Temple at Jerusalem (vs 7, 8), Nehemiah, who also had been appointed as governor of the province of Judea, journeyed to the satrapy Beyond the River, delivered his royal credentials to the proper authorities, and then went to Jerusalem (vs 9–11). Keeping his plans to himself for the time being, he inspected the walls by night (vs 12–16) and then laid a plan before the leaders at Jerusalem for restoring the wall (vs 17, 18). The work was begun at once, and despite repeated attempts to halt it (chs 4:1–23 6:1–19), it was completed in a comparatively short time (ch 6:15). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In his role as governor, Nehemiah also instituted social reforms, particularly with respect to the oppression of the poor by the rich (ch 5:1–14). He also planned and carried out the repopulation of the city of Jerusalem (chs 7 11). Assisted by Ezra, who had preceded him to Jerusalem, he carried out a series of religious reforms (chs 8–10), including the public reading of the Law and instruction in it (ch 8). When Nehemiah drew up, and called upon the people to sign, a covenant of reform, leaders, priests, and people entered into a solemn covenant, pledging themselves to the worship of the true God (chs 9 10). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
After serving Judah as governor for 12 years (ch 5:14) Nehemiah went back to Susa, but later returned to Jerusalem for a 2nd term as governor (ch 13:6, 7). In the interval the people had again lapsed into sin, so that new reform efforts were required.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "my messenger." His parents are unknown and he is simply referred to as having a "burden" or "oracle" for Israel, from the title of the book that bears his name. He is a prophet after the return of the Jews from Babylon.</shortdescription>
    <article>Malachi, name means "my messenger." Author of the last of "the twelve" or so-called Minor Prophets, the book of Malachi. Possibly the Hebrew name is a contraction for Mal’akîyah, "messenger of the Lord." Nothing is known about his life and ministry beyond what his book implies as to the circumstances under which he bore his message. Some have suggested that Malachi was not the name of the author, but simply a title based on ch 3:1 cf. ch 4:5, 6. However, the fact that the other prophetic books carry as their titles the names of their respective authors suggests that Malachi may have been a personal name.</article>

    <shortdescription>In the first year of the reign of Darius, Daniel knows the 70-year prophecy is coming to a conclusion and he sets his face to pray earnestly for his people. It is a prayer of confession and supplication for God to fulfill His promise.</shortdescription>
    <article>Because of his abilities and integrity, the Persians did not execute Daniel but established him in high office. Although busy amid the affairs of state, the prophet did not cease to study the Word of God. Daniel was obviously perplexed as to how to relate what had been revealed to him in the vision of ch. 8 to the events of the immediate future—the return of the Jews at the end of the 70 years (Jer. 29:10). This period had now almost expired. Little wonder that Daniel’s attention was focused upon the time prophecy. He was anxious lest the Lord should delay the liberation of His captive people.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Although the Lord had promised deliverance to His people at the time appointed, Daniel knew of the conditional nature of many of God’s promises (see Jer. 18:7–10). He may have feared that the impenitence of his people might postpone the fulfillment of the promise. Moreover, the vision of Dan. 8 had predicted further desolation for the sanctuary and the city. His lack of understanding of "the vision of the evening and the morning" (v. 26) must have left him in deep perplexity. Verses 4–19 record one of the outstanding prayers of the OT. It is a prayer on behalf of the people of God, offered by a sincere petitioner.</article>

    <shortdescription>Darius II is referred to in the Bible as Darius the Persian. He is the son of Artaxerxes I.</shortdescription>
    <article>Darius the Persian (Neh 12:22) is probably Darius II (424/23–405/04 b.c.), the son and successor of Artaxerxes I. The various lists of ecclesiastical officers given in the book of Nehemiah seem to have their terminal point in his reign. Many commentators identify him with Darius III (336–331 b.c.), who was defeated by Alexander the Great, on the basis of identifying Jaddua of Josephus (Ant. xi. 8. 4, 5) with the Jaddua of Neh 12:11 and 22. This identification, however, is very uncertain.</article>

    <shortdescription>Ezra is sent by Artaxerxes I to Jerusalem to set up structures of government for the Jews, also giving him authority to bring back any Jew who wanted to return to their homeland. He takes with him a diplomatic letter from the king.</shortdescription>
    <article>Ezra is sent by King Artaxerxes to Jerusalem in the king's seventh year. Ezra probably counted the 7th year of Artaxerxes according to the Jewish custom, that is, in terms of the Jewish civil calendar year, which began in the fall. The 7th regnal year of Artaxerxes I began in the fall of 458 b.c. and ended in the fall of 457. Ezra arrives in Jerusalem. From v. 9 it appears that the first day of the first month (Nisan) of the religious year had been selected for the beginning of the journey. This is not surprising, since the dry season was usually used for such a journey, one that a caravan required several months to complete. Similarly, all military campaigns were begun in the spring. The day of departure, according to the Jewish calendar was most probably March 27, 457 b.c. The time occupied on the way was nearly four months. The exiles arrived at Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month (Ab), or approximately July 23, 457 b.c. That it took Ezra’s group four months to reach Jerusalem seems at first thought a long time, but it should not be forgotten that a caravan like his must have taken a number of prolonged rests, one of which is recorded as occurring at Ahava (ch. 8:15). The log of the march of the army of the younger Cyrus from Ephesus to Cunaxa near Babylon provides an actual record of such a journey. Although Cunaxa was reached in 91 marching days, the entire journey, including resting days, occupied about half a year (Xenophon Anabasis ii. 1. 6). We need not be surprised, therefore, that Ezra’s journey occupied four months. Some delay must almost certainly have been occasioned by the perils of the trek (see ch. 8:31). God blessed their journey. Verse 9 indicates the special divine favor here referred to probably includes the royal response to Ezra’s request (see v. 6), and deliverance from enemies who had intended to attack the caravan on the way (see ch. 8:21–23, 31).</article>

    <shortdescription>The beginning of the 70 weeks (490 year) prophecy is 457 B.C. It is marked by the command to restore and rebuild Jerusalem and spoken of in Daniel 9:25. The decree is given by Artaxerxes I in the 7th year of his reign over Persia.</shortdescription>
    <article>At the time this vision was given, Jerusalem and the Temple were still in ruins. Heaven announces that a command will be issued to rebuild and restore, and that from that date a definite number of years will reach to the long-looked-for Messiah. Three decrees dealing with the repatriation of the Jews are recorded in the book of Ezra: the first in the first year of Cyrus, about 537 (Ezra 1:1–4) the second in the reign of Darius I, soon after 520 (Ezra 6:1–12) the third in the 7th year of Artaxerxes, 458/457 b.c. (Ezra 7:1–26). See further Vol. III, pp. 97–104. In their decrees neither Cyrus nor Darius made any genuine provision for the restoration of the civil state as a complete unit, though a restoration of both the religious and the civil government was promised in the prophecy of Daniel. The decree of the 7th year of Artaxerxes was the first to give the Jewish state full autonomy, subject to Persian overlordship.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
One of the double-dated papyri found at Elephantine, Egypt, a Jewish colony (see Vol. III, pp. 103–107), was written in Artaxerxes’ accession year in January, 464 b.c. From this, the only known document of that year, compared with other ancient records, it can be deduced that by Jewish reckoning his "beginning of reign," or "accession year" (see Vol. II, pp. 138, 139), began after the Jewish New Year of 465 b.c. and ended at the next New Year in the fall of 464. Hence his "first year" (his first full calendar year) would be from the fall of 464 to the fall of 463. The 7th year of Artaxerxes would then extend from the fall of 458 to the fall of 457. The specifications of the decree were not carried out until after Ezra returned from Babylon, which was the late summer or early fall of 457 b.c.</article>

    <shortdescription>The 2,300 day prophecy is the longest time prophecy in Scripture. It describes a period stretching from the command to rebuild Jerusalem (457 B.C.) to the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary (A.D. 1844), an end-time work of judgment in heaven.</shortdescription>
    <article>The longest time prophecy in the Bible is found in Daniel 8:14. “And he said to me, ‘For two thousand three hundred days; then the sanctuary shall be cleansed’” (NKJV). This amazing period of history can be understood, as other prophecies in Daniel, by using the historicist “day for a year” principle of prophetic interpretation (see Numbers 14:34 and Ezekiel 4:4-6). This means the 2,300 days symbolically represent 2,300 years. The time frame can be calculated by studying Daniel 9 to begin in 457 B.C. and extend to A.D. 1844. The cleansing of the sanctuary is a reference to Christ’s “Day of Atonement” work in the heavenly sanctuary of judgment and putting away sin.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Cleansing the Sanctuary&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
There was an intense interest in prophecy during the second great Advent awakening in America during the late 1700s and early 1800s. Many believed that the reference to Daniel 8:14 and the cleansing of the sanctuary referred to the earth being cleansed (purified by fire) at Christ’s second coming. But after setting a date and being disappointed, many dropped their interest in prophecy. But a small group persevered and came to understand that this reference spoke of an event taking place in heaven. Since the earthly sanctuary (and its services) was a copy of the heavenly sanctuary (see Hebrews 9), understanding the Day of Atonement opened a window of understanding to Christ’s work in the heavenly sanctuary.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The sanctuary illustrates three parts of Jesus’ work for our salvation: His substitutionary sacrifice, His priestly mediation, and the final judgment. When Jesus died on the cross and later entered heaven, He began His role as mankind’s mediator (see 1 Timothy 2:5). This was represented by the daily sacrifices in the earthly sanctuary. But, once a year the earthly sanctuary was “cleansed” of sins through the Day of Atonement. Just as sins were placed on the priest and onto the sanctuary on earth, so Christ took our sins upon Himself. This day illustrated the judgment process that dealt with the eradication of sin. It foreshadowed Christ’s work of banishing sin for all eternity. This aspect of the judgment work begins with investigation before being carried out.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Daniel 8:14 refers to Christ’s role of cleansing the heavenly sanctuary through examining the records in preparation for the final removal of sin from the heavenly books. Daniel 7:9, 10 tells of this time of judgment. In particular the “little horn” power that has been waging war against God’s people is condemned. This religio-political power has opposed “the daily sacrifices [Christ’s priestly work]; and he cast truth down to the ground” (8:12).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Daniel 9 Explains Daniel 8&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Daniel 8:27 tells us that after seeing this vision that Daniel was “astonished by the vision, but no one understood it.” In answer to Daniel’s prayer to understand the vision of chapter 8, the angel Gabriel comes to explain what he saw. The only element not covered in Daniel 8 is the time frame. The 70-weeks prophecy of Daniel 9 unlocks the mystery of the 2,300 day prophecy. This prophecy begins with, “Seventy weeks are determined for your people and for your holy city…” (v. 24). The word “determined” can also be understood as “cut off.” These 70 weeks are a part of the 2,300 days.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The beginning of the 70 weeks (and the 2,300 day prophecy) is clearly stated: “Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the command to restore and build Jerusalem until Messiah the Prince, there shall be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks …” (v. 25). This took place in 457 B.C. and the seventh year of Artaxerxes. The 70 weeks (or 490 years) therefore ended in A.D. 34. That leaves 1,810 year and when added to A.D. 34 brings us to the year 1844.&lt;BR /&gt;
The culmination of the 2,300 prophecy in A.D. 1844 was when Christ came to the Ancient of Days (Daniel 7:13) and began the final phase of His high-priestly ministry in the heavenly sanctuary. His ministry was the “antitype” of the Day of Atonement, that is the fuller picture of what the earthly sanctuary symbolized. This work, described in Daniel 7, depicts a phase of judgment that required investigation that takes place before the second coming of Christ when He returns “to give to everyone according to his work (Revelation 22:12).</article>

    <shortdescription>The seventy-weeks prophecy of Daniel 9 focuses on the Jewish nation and people. The prophet Daniel is shown a time period that includes the coming of the Messiah and the end of the sacrificial system with the gospel going to the Gentiles.</shortdescription>
    <article>Daniel 9 contains an interesting prophecy about seventy-weeks—or 490 days. The Bible teaches that in prophecy, a day represents a year (see Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6). So what does this 490-year prophecy mean? We find the answer by seeing the connection between Daniel 8 and 9. Daniel was unable to hear the full message of Daniel 8 and became sick (8:27). But in Daniel 9:20–23, the angel Gabriel returns to give him more understanding of a part of the great 2,300-day (year) prophecy, particularly the part that relates to “your people” (v. 24), the Jewish nation.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Daniel 9:24 tells us, “Seventy weeks are determined for your people and for you holy city to finish transgression, to make an end of sins, to make reconciliation for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy.”&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The word “determined” means “cut off.” The 70 weeks (or 490 years) are a piece of the larger 2,300-day prophecy. We can know the beginning of these two prophecies from Daniel 9:25: “Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the command to restore and build Jerusalem until Messiah the Prince, there shall be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks.” This command was given by Artaxerxes Longimanus and went into effect in the fall of 457 B.C.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
What does “seven weeks and sixty-two weeks” (or 69 weeks, which represents 483 years) represent? If we add 483 years to 457 B.C., we are taken to the date of Jesus’ baptism in the fall of A.D. 27, when Christ was “anointed” (which is the meaning of the word “messiah”) by the Holy Spirit. When Jesus began His ministry, the Bible actually says, “The time is fulfilled” (Mark 1:15), showing the fulfillment of this time period.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Daniel 9:26 says, “And after the sixty-two weeks Messiah shall be cut off,” which is a clear fulfillment of the crucifixion of Jesus on Calvary for the sins of the whole world; this took place in A.D. 31. In fact, verse 27 specifically says, “But in the middle of the week He shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering,” which perfectly fits the time frame of Jesus’ ministry. We know that even the temple curtain separating the Holy and Most Holy Place was torn in half, signifying this ending of the sacrificial system.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This last “week” (7 years) ended in A.D. 34 when several important events took place. In that year the Jewish council rejected the gospel by stoning Stephen, thus sealing their rejection of Christ. At this time the disciples were scattered and began preaching the gospel to the Gentiles. Saul, who became Paul, started his work shortly after this event.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
And so the 70 weeks (or 490 years) of Daniel 9 were decreed for the Jews and Jerusalem. It was a time period “cut off” (or a piece of) the greater 2,300-day (year) prophecy of Daniel 8 and actually gives us the key to both understand the beginning (457 B.C.) of the longest prophecy in Scripture—and also the end.  When we remove 70 weeks (490 years) from 2,300 days (years) we are left with 1,810 years. By adding this number to A.D. 34, we are brought to the year A.D. 1844. (See the article on the 2,300-day prophecy for more information.)</article>

    <shortdescription>After secretly surveying the walls at night, Nehemiah calls the people in Jerusalem together and says, "Let us rise up and build." The people unite behind his leadership, though there is resistance from Sanballat and Tobiah.</shortdescription>
    <article>After surveying the broken down walls of Jerusalem, Nehemiah rallies the people to rebuild the city's walls. It is fitting to find Eliashib the high priest setting a right example on this occasion. Later on he became "allied" by marriage to Tobiah (ch. 13:4) and was guilty of profaning the Temple (ch. 13:5). According to the line of high priests given in ch. 12:10, 11, it appears that Eliashib was the son of Joiakim, and the grandson of Jeshua, who had returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel (Ezra 2:2 3:2). The special purpose of this chapter seems to be the rendering of honor where honor was due—the placing on record of the names of the men who nobly came to the front on this important occasion, sacrificed ease to duty, and thereby exposed themselves to a threatened hostile attack (ch. 4:18–20).</article>

    <shortdescription>After the Jews return from Babylon and, under the leadership of Ezra &amp; Nehemiah, reconstruct the Temple and the city walls, the people request that Ezra read to them from the book of the Law. All gather in an open square to listen carefully.</shortdescription>
    <article>The introduction to the narrative of Nehemiah 8 is identical with that of Ezra 3 (Neh. 7:73 to 8:1 cf. Ezra 3:1). The same matter, the assembling of the people on the approach of the seventh month, is described in the same words. But the object of this assembling of the people was different from that mentioned in Ezra 3. In Ezra, they met to restore the altar of burnt offering and the sacrificial worship now they gather for the purpose of celebrating the great feasts of the 7th month and for religious instruction. It does not seem that the people were summoned for this gathering, but habitually arrived at the Temple at that time. It is therefore likely that Ezra had instituted such meetings after his return from Babylon 13 years earlier, and that it had become a habit in Judea to gather in Jerusalem at the beginning of the civil year for instruction and for the celebration of the three great feasts of that month.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It is remarkable that the people came asking for instruction. Though many of them were negligent in observing the law, they nevertheless felt a desire to hear it read. Not content with existing conditions, they desired to reach a higher level in their spiritual experience and were convinced that the hearing of God’s Word would benefit them. The people were acquainted with the Pentateuch, here referred to, and knew that Ezra was versed in it. The reading began on the New Year’s Day of the civil calendar. This first day of the 7th month was distinguished above the other new moons of the year as the Feast of Trumpets, and celebrated as a high festival by a solemn assembly and cessation from labor (Lev. 23:23–25 Num. 29:1–6). The instruction lasted five or six hours. That it did not consist of incessant reading is apparent from vs. 4–8, which explain that the reading went on alternately with explanatory interpretations of the law by the Levites.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The portion read must have deeply impressed the assembled throng. The portions of Scripture read consisted of certain sections of Deuteronomy, together with other parts of the Torah, selected to convict the people of their sin in transgressing the commands of the Lord, and to remind them of the punishments to which may they thus exposed themselves. They were so moved that they mourned and wept. This induced Nehemiah, Ezra, and the Levites to encourage and comfort them.</article>

    <shortdescription>Nehemiah, commissioned by the king of Persia Artaxerxes I, goes to Jerusalem to oversee the reconstruction of the city's broken down walls. Under his leadership the people complete the job.</shortdescription>
    <article>Eventually, Nehemiah and the men of Judah finished rebuilding the walls around Jerusalem. Though the year is not mentioned here, the 20th year of Artaxerxes is clearly intended (see on ch. 2:1). This agrees with the other chronological statements of this book. In Nisan (the 1st month) Nehemiah had received permission from the king to go to Jerusalem. According to chs. 5:14 and 13:6 he was governor in Jerusalem from the 20th year onward and must therefore have set out for that place immediately after receiving royal authorization for his plans. If so, he arrived in Jerusalem during the fourth month. After three days he surveyed the wall, and soon thereafter called a public assembly to present his plan for rebuilding the wall and to enlist their cooperation (ch. 2:11–17). All this may have taken place in the course of the fourth month, so that the beginning of the work could actually have taken place either before the end of the 4th month or in the beginning of the 5th. It is not clear from Nehemiah’s words how he computed the 52 days during which the wall was in process of reconstruction. He could have reckoned the period from the day of resuming the work until it was finished, including the weekly Sabbaths, so that the number of working days would be only 44 or 45 or he could have meant that there were 52 working days. Thus the period of activity would cover about 60 days. In the first case the beginning of the work would have fallen in the early days of Ab (the 5th month), in the latter case in the last part of Tammuz (the 4th month). According to the Jewish calendar followed by Nehemiah, Elul 25 in the 20th year of Artaxerxes was approximately September 21, 444 b.c.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Some commentators have contended that 52 days do not provide enough time to rebuild the wall. They have preferred to accept the two years and four months given by Josephus (Antiquities xi. 5. 8) as a more reasonable length of time. However, there is no need to reject the Bible figure in favor of Josephus because: (1) Nehemiah’s work was not a complete rebuilding of the wall, but in many parts only repair work (see on ch. 1:3) (2) it was carried out in great haste in the face of threatened attack and (3) the completion of the wall in such a short time was so incredible to the enemies of the Jews that they considered it a miracle (ch. 6:16).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>After having served as governor of Judah for 12 years, Nehemiah goes back to Susa Shushan in Persia. He then returns to serve as governor again. During his absence the people fall into spiritual apathy and need reformation.</shortdescription>
    <article>Nehemiah returned to Persia for a period of time. The stay of Nehemiah at the court of Persia must have continued longer than a year, for it seems unlikely that so many illegal acts on the part of the Jewish community as Nehemiah discovered upon his return could have occurred in so short a time. At some point he returned to Jerusalem. It is from Nehemiah 13:6 only that we know of Nehemiah’s two terms as governor. His first term was for 12 years (ch. 5:14), but no indication is given of the length of his second term. It must have ended before 407 b.c., when, we know from an Elephantine letter, the governor of Judea was Bigvai (see on ch. 12:11).</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "defender of man." He is one of the greatest conquerors in history, the king of Macedonia who was tutored by Aristotle and conquered the known world by age 30. His kingdom is the belly of brass in Daniel's image of the nations.</shortdescription>
    <article>Alexander III was born in Pella in 356 B.C., was educated by Aristotle, and became king of Macedonia in 336 B.C. During his rule, he united the factions of Greece and led his nation to become the ultimate global power, establishing its presence and spreading its Hellenistic influence throughout the known world. Along the way, he founded more than 70 cities across three continents, spanning over two million square miles, from Macedonia to Egypt to India. He most notable achievement, of course, was conquering the Persian Empire against overwhelming odds. Alexander the Great is believed to have died from Malaria in 323 B.C. at the age of 32. Without a heir, his kingdom was divided between four Grecian generals, weakening Greece and paving the way for the eventual rise of the Roman Empire. The book of Daniel was written 250 years before his birth, yet it describes his country—the leopard—in great detail, accurately recording how quickly he would conquer the kingdoms of the world and how, after his death, Greece broke apart into four factions. See Daniel 8:1–22.</article>

    <shortdescription>The third kingdom spoken of in Nebuchadnezzar's dream of a great image, the thighs made of brass (or bronze), describes the kingdom of Greece. Alexander the Great conquered Medo-Persia &amp; set up the Macedonian/Greek empire. It divided into four parts.</shortdescription>
    <article>The successor of the Medo-Persian Empire was the “Greek” (more properly Macedonian or Hellenistic) Empire of Alexander and his successors (see ch. 8:20, 21).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Hebrew word for Greece is Yawan (Javan), which is the name of one of the sons of Japheth. Javan is mentioned in the genealogy immediately after Madai, the progenitor of the Medes (see on Gen. 10:2). About the time the Israelites were settling in Canaan, those Indo-European tribes later called Greeks were migrating in successive waves into the Aegean region (mainland Greece, the islands, and the western coasts of Asia Minor), conquering or driving out the earlier Mediterranean inhabitants. These displacements were connected with the movement of the Peoples of the Sea (including the Philistines) into the eastern Mediterranean coastlands (see Vol. II, pp. 27, 33, 34). Ionian Greeks were found in Egypt in the time of Psamtik I (663–610 B.C.) and in Babylonia during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar (605–562 B.C.), as attested by written records.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Greece was divided into small city-states with a common language but little concerted action. When we think of ancient Greece we think chiefly of the golden age of Greek civilization, under the leadership of Athens, in the 5th century B.C. This flowering of Greek culture followed the period of the greatest united effort of the divided city-states—the successful defense of Greece against Persia about the time of Queen Esther.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The “Grecia” of ch. 8:21 does not refer to the divided city-states of classical Greece, but rather to the later Macedonian kingdom that conquered Persia. The Macedonians, a kindred nation north of Greece proper, conquered the Greek cities and incorporated them for the first time into a strong, united state. Alexander the Great, inheriting his father’s newly expanded Greco-Macedonian kingdom, set out to extend Macedonian dominion and Greek culture eastward, and conquered the Persian Empire. The prophecy represents the kingdom of Greece as following Persia, because Greece never became united into a kingdom until the formation of the Macedonian Empire, which replaced Persia as the leading world power of that time (for parallel prophecies see on chs. 7:6 8:5–8, 21, 22 11:2–4).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The last reigning king of the Persian Empire was Darius III (Codomannus), who was defeated by Alexander at the battles of Granicus (334 B.C.), Issus (333 B.C.), and Arbela, or Gaugamela (331 B.C.).</article>

    <shortdescription>The third animal coming out of the sea in Daniel's vision represents Greece and is represented by a leopard with four wings and four heads. Alexander the Great quickly conquered the world, but his kingdom was divided into four parts after his death.</shortdescription>
    <article>The leopard is a fierce, carnivorous animal noted for the swiftness and agility of its movements. The power succeeding the Persian Empire is identified in ch. 8:21 as “Grecia.” This “Grecia” must not be confused with the Greece of the classical period, inasmuch as that period preceded the fall of Persia. The “Grecia” of Daniel was the semi-Greek Macedonian Empire of Alexander the Great, which inaugurated what is called the Hellenistic period. Not until Alexander’s day could reference be made to the “first king” (ch. 8:21) of a Greek empire who was “a mighty king” with “great dominion.”&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In 336 Alexander succeeded to the throne of Macedonia, a semi-Greek state on the northern border of Greece. Alexander’s father, Philip, had already united most of the city-states of Greece under his rule by 338 B.C. Among the factors that spurred the young king on in his plans were personal ambition, the need for economic expansion, the desire to spread Greek culture, and a not unnatural animosity toward the Persians because of their past relations with his countrymen.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Four wings of a fowl. Although the leopard is itself a swift creature, its natural agility seems inadequate to describe the amazing speed of Alexander’s conquest. The symbolic vision represented the animal with wings added to it, not two but four, denoting superlative speed. The symbol most fittingly describes the lightning speed with which Alexander and his Macedonians in less than a decade came into possession of the greatest empire the world had yet known. There is no other example in ancient times of such rapid movements of troops on so large and successful a scale.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Four heads. Obviously parallel with the four horns of the he-goat, which represented the four kingdoms (later reduced to three) that occupied the territory of Alexander’s short-lived conquests. For some years, however, Alexander’s Macedonian generals attempted to preserve, in theory if not in fact, the unity of the vast empire. Alexander died without arranging for the succession to his throne. First his weak-minded half brother Philip and then his posthumous son Alexander were the titular rulers under the regency of one or another of the generals, and the empire was divided into a large number of provinces, the most important of which were controlled by about six leading generals as satraps.</article>

    <shortdescription>Daniel's vision of a ram and male goat describe Medo-Persia and Greece. The male goat moves swiftly and destroys the ram. Alexander's moves were swift. When he died, his kingdom was divided into four parts.</shortdescription>
    <article>Alexander the Great, being a Macedonian with a Greek education, promoted the spread of Greek language and culture in all conquered countries by forceful and by peaceful means. In a few years (334–323 B.C.) he crushed the Persian armies of Darius III, Persia’s last king, and led his Macedonian and Greek soldiers victoriously through Asia Minor, Syria, and Palestine to the ancient land of the Nile, which easily fell to him. He then took Mesopotamia and the Persian homeland, pressing on until he reached the Indus Valley finally, his soldiers refused to continue farther the conquest of unknown lands and kingdoms. He then set about to consolidate his empire and establish a union between the Orient and the Occident, choosing the ancient city of Babylon as his capital and residence, but his death ended his plans of a united Greco-Macedonian-Oriental empire (Jerusalem From 20 BC to AD 70). Yet one result of his conquest remained. Although his successors fought for decades against one another, and split up the inheritance of Alexander into sections of varying sizes and strength, they continued to promote the spread of Greek language and culture over the eastern Mediterranean world.</article>

    <shortdescription>In Daniel's vision of a ram &amp; male goat, the goat's great horn is broken &amp; four horns grow up toward the four winds. This is the Hellenistic (Grecian) Empire led by Alexander the Great. After his death four generals divided the kingdom into 4 parts.</shortdescription>
    <article>The Hellenistic world, composed of Greece, Macedonia, and the Hellenized East, remained a single Greco-Macedonian-Oriental civilization, more or less unified by its Greek elements, long after it lost political unity. After the death of Alexander his Macedonian leaders put on the throne his half brother Philip and Alexander’s posthumous son, Alexander.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The successive regents for these puppet kings tried to hold the empire together, but others, who governed various territories as satraps of the empire, strove to divide it among themselves. Scarcely more than 20 years after Alexander’s death the last strong claimant to the central power was defeated, at the battle of Ipsus (301 B.C.), by a coalition of 4 (Ptolemy, Cassander, Lysimachus, and Seleucus) who split the empire into 4 kingdoms. In 20 years more these 4 were reduced to 3 when Seleucus I, ruler of the eastern division, conquered the northern division. From then on the territory of Alexander’s empire comprised three principal Hellenistic kingdoms plus numerous small, unstable, or short-lived states. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
These three kingdoms, ruled by the descendants of Alexander’s Macedonian leaders, were Macedonia (generally including Greece), Egypt, and the Seleucid Empire (later called Syria, after it had lost its easternmost lands) and they continued until the Hellenistic world was taken over, piece by piece, by the rising power of Rome. Though they were annexed as the Roman provinces of Macedonia (146 B.C.), Syria (64/63 B.C.), and Egypt (30 B.C.), they retained the influence of Greek thought. Greek continued to be the language of the eastern half of the Roman Empire.</article>

    <shortdescription>Antiochus IV., surnamed "Epiphanes" i.e., the Illustrious. He is known for his persecution of the Jews and desecration of the Temple in Jerusalem.</shortdescription>
    <article>Antiochus IV., surnamed "Epiphanes" i.e., the Illustrious, succeeded his brother Seleucus (B.C. 175). His career and character are prophetically described by Daniel (11:21-32). He was a "vile person." In a spirit of revenge he organized an expedition against Jerusalem, which he destroyed, putting vast multitudes of its inhabitants to death in the most cruel manner. From this time the Jews began the great war of independence under their heroic Maccabean leaders with marked success, defeating the armies of Antiochus that were sent against them. Enraged at this, Antiochus marched against them in person, threatening utterly to exterminate the nation but on the way he was suddenly arrested by the hand of death (B.C. 164).</article>

    <shortdescription>The fourth kingdom described in Nebuchadnezzar's dream of a great image is "strong as iron" and represents the kingdom of Rome. It was the strongest and lasted the longest. Rome took over the Greek kingdoms.</shortdescription>
    <article>The fourth kingdom is not the later, divided stage of Alexander’s empire, but the next empire, which conquered the Macedonian world. Daniel elsewhere represents the Hellenistic monarchies, the divisions of Alexander’s empire, by the Grecian goat’s four horns (ch. 8:22), not by a separate beast (compare the four heads of the leopard see on ch. 7:6). It is obvious that the kingdom that succeeded the divided remnants of the Macedonian Empire of Alexander was what Gibbon has aptly called the “iron monarchy” of Rome, though it was not a monarchy at the time it first became the leading world power.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Early Rome was settled, long before the traditional date of 753 B.C., by Latin tribes who had come into Italy in successive waves about the time other related Indo-European tribes had settled in Greece. From about the 8th to the 5th century the Latin city-state was ruled by neighboring Etruscan kings. About 500 B.C. the Roman state became a republic, and remained a republic for nearly 500 years. By 265 B.C. all Italy was under Roman control. By 200 B.C. Rome had emerged victorious from the life-and-death struggle with her powerful North African rival Carthage (originally a Phoenician colony). Henceforth Rome was mistress of the western Mediterranean, and more powerful than any of the states in the east, although she had not yet come to grips with them. From then on Rome first dominated and then absorbed, in turn, the three surviving kingdoms of Alexander’s successors (see on ch. 7:6), and thus became the next great world power after Alexander’s. This fourth empire was the longest lived and most extensive of the four, stretching in the 2nd Christian century from Britain to the Euphrates. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Breaketh in pieces. All that we have been able to reconstruct of Roman history confirms this description. Rome won her territory by the force or the fear of her armed might. At first she intervened in international affairs in a struggle for her life against her rival, Carthage, and was drawn into war after war. Then, crushing one opponent after another, she finally became the aggressive, irresistible conqueror of the Mediterranean world and Western Europe. At the beginning of the Christian Era and a little later, the iron might of the Roman legions stood back of the Pax Romana—the Roman peace. Rome was the largest and strongest empire the world had hitherto known.</article>

    <article>&lt;B&gt;Fourth beast&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
There was, presumably, no parallel in the natural world by which to designate this hideous creature, for no comparison is made as in the case of the first three beasts. There should be no question, however, but that it represents the same power that is portrayed by the iron legs of the great image (see on ch. 2:40). It is clear from history that the world power succeeding the third prophetic empire was Rome. However, the transition was gradual so that it is impossible to point to a specific event as marking the change. As already stated, the empire of Alexander was divided after 301 into four (later three) Hellenistic kingdoms, and their replacement by the Roman Empire was a gradual process in several principal stages.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
By 200 B.C., when Carthage was no longer a rival (although it was not destroyed until more than half a century later), Rome was the mistress of the western Mediterranean and had begun to enter into contacts with the East, where she was thenceforth to become dominant also. In 197 Rome defeated Macedonia and set up the Greek states under her own protection. In 190 Rome defeated Antiochus III and took the Seleucid territory as far east as the Taurus Mountains. In 168, at the Battle of Pydna, Rome ended the monarchy in Macedonia, dividing it up into four confederacies and probably in the same year warned Antiochus IV away from his attack on Egypt. In 146 Rome annexed Macedonia as a province and placed most of the Greek cities under the governor of Macedonia.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
If Rome’s mastery of the East is reckoned from the removal of the monarchs of the three Hellenistic kingdoms, by Roman power, the date 168 may be regarded as the first step in the process. However, the Seleucid and Ptolemaic kings remained on their thrones till much later, 63 in Syria and 30 in Egypt. If the dates of the annexation of these three kingdoms as Roman provinces are chosen, the dates would be 146, 64, and 30 respectively. Some historians emphasize 168 because by that time Rome had conquered Macedonia and had saved Egypt from falling to the Seleucid kingdom by merely forbidding the invasion of Antiochus IV. This demonstrated that Rome virtually controlled all three kingdoms even though she had as yet conquered only one of them.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
No single date can be given for a gradual process. Regardless of one’s choice of the most significant date or dates, the change of world power to Rome is clear, and the absorption of the territory of Alexander from Macedonia to the Euphrates was completed in 30 B.C. ;Great iron teeth. These enormous metallic teeth speak of cruelty and strength. As the animal tore to pieces and devoured its prey with these grotesque fangs, so Rome devoured nations and peoples in its conquests. Sometimes whole cities were destroyed, as in the case of Corinth in 146 B.C., then again kingdoms, such as Macedonia and the Seleucid dominions had been, were divided into provinces.</article>

    <shortdescription>In Daniel's vision of the ram and male goat, a little horn grows up "to the host of heaven." The initial work and expansion of this power from Rome was political in nature.</shortdescription>
    <article>Little Horn. A symbol in the book of Daniel (chs 7 and 8) for a great foe of God’s chosen people. To the Hebrews, originally a pastoral people familiar with the manner in which domestic animals such as rams and bulls used their horns for self-defense and attack, the horn naturally became a symbol of power. Passages that describe the “little horn” and its activities are chs 7:8, 20–26; 8:9–14, 23–26. Parallel passages whose context makes evident that the same power and same developments are being described in literal language are chs 9:26, 27; 11:29–45; 12:1, 6–11. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The characteristics ascribed to the little horn in chs 7 and 8, and the activities attributed to it, lead to the conclusion that the two visions described the same power in different aspects of its activity and from a slightly different point of view. In each instance the “horn” is “little” when it is first seen on the prophetic stage (chs 7:8; 8:9), but in time it grows to be very great (chs 7:20; 8:9). In chs 7 it comes up “among” (v 8) and “after” (v 24) the 10 horns of the 4th terrible beast (v 7), displacing 3 of the 10 as it rises (vs 8, 20, 24), whereas the little horn of ch 8 comes forth after the “four notable” horns that replaced the “great horn” of the ram have appeared, toward the close of the dominion exercised by the 4 horns “when the transgressors are come to the full” (vs 23, 24). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The little horn of ch 7 is said to have “eyes like the eyes of man” (vs 8, 20), and the little horn of ch 8 is said to be “cunning” in its methods of operation (v 25, RSV). The interpretation of the little horn of ch 7 clearly implies that it represents a “king” (v 24), whereas that of ch 8 is specifically declared to represent a “king” (v 23). The horn of ch 7 makes “war with the saints,” prevails against them, and wears them out (vs 21, 25); the horn of ch 8 casts down some of the “host,” that is, the “holy people,” to the ground and stamps upon them (vs 10, 13, 24). With its “mouth that spake very great things” the horn of ch 7 speaks “great words against the most High” and attempts “to change times and laws” ordained by the Most High (vs 20, 25); the horn of ch 8 “magnified himself even to the prince of the host” (v 11), who is described in v 25 as “the Prince of princes”—obviously the Lord—and “cast down the truth to the ground” (v 12). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The period of time during which the little horn oppresses “the saints of the most High” is said to be “a time and times and the dividing of time” (Dan 7:25; cf. ch 12:7, “time, times, and an half”). The little horn of ch 8 takes away “the daily sacrifice” and casts down “the place of his sanctuary” (v 11), but after a period called “two thousand and three hundred days” (v 14) the sanctuary is “cleansed” (KJV), or “restored to its rightful state” (RSV). In ch 7 the coming of “the Ancient of days” in judgment deprives the little horn of its power and awards the kingdom to the “saints of the most High” (vs 18, 22, 26, 27). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In ch 8, at the close of the specified period of time the sanctuary is “cleansed” of the “transgression of desolation” erected in it by the little horn (vs 13, 14). In ch 9:26, 27 the same power destroys Jerusalem and the Temple, causing “the sacrifice and the oblation to cease” and desolating the sanctuary. In ch 11:30, 31 the same power enters “the glorious land”—Palestine—(vs 16, 41, 45), stands up against “the prince of the covenant” (v 22), pollutes the sanctuary and takes away the daily sacrifice, sets up the desolating abomination (vs 30, 31), and conspires to obliterate the worship of the true God (v 30)—all for “a time, times, and an half” (ch 12:7).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Our Lord Himself applied the parallel prophecy of Dan 11:31 and 12:11 to the Romans (see Mt 24:15–20 cf. Lk 21:20–24), a prediction that was fulfilled in A.D. 70 when the latter destroyed Jerusalem and the Temple and brought the Jewish nation to an end. Some Protestant interpreters have adopted the ancient Jewish interpretation; others have applied the prophecy of the little horn, first to the events of A.D. 70, and second to papal Rome in past centuries, when it was intolerant of all dissent and dissenters and persecuted those who did not consent to its authority.</article>

    <article>The Festival of Dedication, also known as Hanukkah, celebrates the reconsecration of the Temple in Jerusalem after it was desecrated by Antiouchus IV. After the persecution of the Jews and desecration of the temple by Antiochus, the Maccabean revolt was able to regain for the Jews control of the temple area. They cleaned and repaired the Temple and reinstituted the traditional forms of worship on a newly built altar. The celebration lasted 8 days, and it commemorated annually by Jews to this day.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Simon, the last surviving son of Mattathias, took over the leadership. He succeeded in obtaining freedom from paying taxes to the Syrians, and in this way gained an independent status for his country and people.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jonathan, Judas’ brother, now took over the leadership in the struggle against the Syrians. For several years he and his band of fearless men could barely hold their own. But a break came when Alcimus died and when the struggle for the throne of Syria made it possible for him to play off one throne pretender against the other. One of these, Alexander Balas, appointed Jonathan high priest in 153 b.c. and thus gave him the badly needed legitimacy to rule the country. Ten years of comparative peace followed, but then another throne pretender, Tryphon, succeeded in treacherously killing Jonathan in 143 b.c.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
After Jonathan’s death, Simon, the last surviving son of Mattathias, took over the leadership. He succeeded in obtaining freedom from paying taxes to the Syrians, and in this way gained an independent status for his country and people. A national plebiscite confirmed him as high priest. But soon thereafter a power struggle broke out within his own family which resulted in his murder by his son-in-law in 135 b.c.</article>

    <shortdescription>Macedonia was divided into 4 republics under the protectorate of Rome, with Greece administered separately. Then in 146 b.c. it was made into a Roman province, governed by a proconsul, with Thessalonica as capital. </shortdescription>
    <article>Macedonia became a minor kingdom, holding a fluctuating control over Greece. Soon thereafter it fell to the Antigonid house, which ruled it until Perseus, the last king of that line, was conquered by the Roman general Aemilius Paulus at Pydna in 168 b.c. Macedonia was divided into 4 republics under the protectorate of Rome, with Greece administered separately. Then in 146 b.c. it was made into a Roman province, governed by a proconsul, with Thessalonica as capital.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Julius Caesar is the well-known Roman general who played a major role in the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. He was assassinated by the a group of Roman senators.</shortdescription>
    <article>Born into the republic of Rome in approximately 100 B.C., Julius Caesar was one of the most successful war generals in history, having never lost a war. Moreover, a political genius with great ambition, he engineered the great Triumvirate, which divided power between three warring factions, saving what was a burgeoning Roman Empire from civil war. However, eventually, Caesar took advantage of political forces, his military prowess, and happenstance to amass great power and was eventually named “dictator for life.” Under his influence, the republic of Rome transformed into the Roman Empire. But shortly thereafter, Caesar was assassinated on March 15, 44 B.C., the date know as the Ides of March. During his eventful life, he was once captured by pirates, was a respected writer, and had an extramarital affair with Cleopatra, whom he would help gain the throne of Egypt. Caesar was the great uncle and adoptive father of Caesar Augustus, the Roman emperor who ordered the census at the time of Jesus’ birth.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "like a hero" or "offspring of a hero." He is the son of Antipater and descendant of the Edomites but a Jew by citizenship and religious profession. He is the king of Judea and Palestine at the time of Jesus' birth, and a great builder.</shortdescription>
    <article>Herod the Great. King of Judea and all Palestine at the time of Jesus’ birth. He was the 2nd son of the Idumean Antipater, and thus a descendant of the ancient Edomites, but he was a Jew by citizenship and religious profession. The kingdom of Herod initially comprised Judea (including Samaria and Idumea) however, Antony took Jericho and its territory and gave it to Cleopatra of Egypt. After the battle at Actium in 31 b.c., from which Octavian emerged victor over Antony, Herod made another switch in affiliation, went to Rhodes where Octavian was, and succeeded in gaining his favor.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Herod’s family life was full of tragedies, and was soiled with the blood of his closest relatives, including three of his own sons and one of his ten wives. Herod was a great builder and the founder of several magnificent cities, which were built in Hellenistic style and splendor. The city of Jerusalem also received his attention. Beginning c. 20 b.c. he rebuilt Zerubbabel’s Temple, which was in a dilapidated condition, and began to erect magnificent buildings in and around the Temple. He also built a royal palace in Jerusalem, one tower of which is still partly visible in the lower section of the so-called "Tower of David" in the citadel. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Although Herod was a Hellenist in heart and practice, and surrounded himself by Hellenistic counselors, he was prudent enough to refrain from suppressing or openly defying the Jewish religion as Antiochus IV had done in the preceding century. However, the Jews hated him because he was an Idumean and a friend of the Romans, and because of his scandalous private life. They resented his extreme cruelty and the imposition upon them of a heavy tax burden necessitated by his extensive building program. The absence of open rebellion during his long reign was due to his unwavering loyalty to the Romans, to his ruthlessness in suppressing every opposition, and to the fact that there was external peace in his day.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Herod the Great appears in the New Testament in the date formula of Lk 1:5, and in the narrative of the "wise men from the east" as told in Mt 2:1–18. Upon hearing that a descendant of David was born in Bethlehem according to an ancient prophecy, the king gave orders to kill all infants in that city. This cruel act is not recorded in secular history. It is in full harmony with his other known acts of atrocity and cruelty. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The last atrocity planned by Herod was fortunately never carried out. Knowing that there would be great rejoicing in the kingdom when the people would learn of his death, he had the principal Jews shut up in the stadium in Jericho, and gave orders to have them killed as soon as he died, in order to provide some mourning over his death. However, his sister Salome and her husband Alexas, who were charged with carrying out this order, foiled his plan by releasing the unfortunate noblemen after his death, thus bringing great joy to many Jewish homes. Herod passed away in his 34th regnal year at the age of 69, in 4/3 b.c., most probably in the spring of 4 b.c.</article>

    <article>Augustus 23 is considered the first emperor of the Roman Empire, which he ruled alone from 27 BC until his death in 14 AD. Born Gaius Octavius Thurinus, he was adopted posthumously by his great-uncle Gaius Julius Caesar in 44 BC via his last will and testament, and between then and 27 BC was officially named Gaius Julius Caesar. In 27 BC the Senate awarded him the honorific Augustus "the revered one", and thus consequently he was Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus.</article>

    <shortdescription>Herod the Great was appointed king of Judea by the Romans in 37 BC. He is known in the Bible for his command to kill all the babies younger than two in Bethlehem.</shortdescription>
    <article>Herod was appointed king of Judeaby the Romans in 37 BC. The kingdom of Herod initially comprised Judea (including Samaria and Idumea). Later Augustus added Jericho, Gadara, Gaza,Batanaea, Trachonitis and Aurantis to Herod’s territory. Herod ruled his kingdom without any serious threats from the outside, so that his reign can be called a period of prosperity.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Herod was a great builder and the founder of several magnificent cities, which were built in Hellenistic style and splendor. These included two cities named in honor of the emperor Augustus: Samaria which he called Sebaste (greek of “Augusta”), and the old Stratos Towerin the coast, which he named Caesarea, and which later became Herod’s capital; 2 that he named for members of his family: Antipatris (formally Aphek), northeast of Joppa and Phasaelis, in the Jordan valley; and 2 cities which bore the name Herodium, one in Transjordan and the other southeast of Bethlehem.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Herod’s family life was full of tragedies and was soiled with the blood of his closest relatives, including 3 of his own sons and one of his ten wives. He appears in the New Testamentin the date formula of Luke 1:5, and in the narrative of the “wisemen from the east” as told in Mt. 2:1-8. Upon hearing that a descendant of David was born in Bethlehem according to an ancient prophecy, the King gave orders to kill all infants in that city. This cruel act is not recorded in secular history but it is in full harmony with his other known acts of atrocity and cruelty. The last atrocity planned by Herod was fortunately never carried out. Knowing that there would be great rejoicing in the kingdom when the people learned of his death, he had the principal Jews shut up in the stadium in Jericho, and gave orders to have them killed as soon as he died, in order to provide some mourning over his death. However, his sister Salome and her husband Alexas, who were charged with carrying out this order, foiled his plan by releasing the unfortunate noblemen after his death, thus bringing great joy to many Jewish homes. Herod passed away in his 34th regnal year at the age of 69 in 4-3BC. Most probably in the spring of 4 BC.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "may he add." He is the husband of Mary and considered by his contemporaries the father of Jesus. When he discovers Mary is pregnant, he plans to divorce her, but is told by an angel she is with Child by the Holy Spirit. He is a carpenter.</shortdescription>
    <article>Joseph. The husband of Mary (Mt 1:16 Lk 3:23), considered by his contemporaries to be the father of Jesus. He seems earlier to have been widowed and apparently had children by a former marriage (see Brethren of the Lord). While engaged to Mary he discovered that she was to have a child and decided to put her away without exposing her but after he was informed in a dream that the child had been miraculously conceived, he married her and brought her child up as his own son (Mt 1:18–25). The birth took place at Bethlehem because Joseph had taken Mary with him from Nazareth, their home town, to Bethlehem in compliance with a census decree that required every individual to register in the town of his ancestors. Since Joseph (as well as Mary) was a member of the tribe of Judah and a descendant of the house of David, he had to fulfill their registration duties at David’s birthplace, Bethlehem (Lk 2:1–16). Joseph was also with Mary when the child Jesus was taken to the Temple for the customary presentation, and heard there the predictions of Simeon and Anna (vs 22–38). Before Herod could carry out his cruel murder of the infants at Bethlehem, Joseph was directed in a dream to go to Egypt hence he took Mary and Jesus to Egypt, returning to Palestine to settle in Nazareth after the death of Herod (Mt 2:13–23). As a faithful Jew he probably went regularly to Jerusalem every year for the great feasts. When Jesus was 12 years old He was taken on the annual pilgrimage to the Passover. It was on this occasion that His parents lost Him, and after a search of 3 days discovered Him in the Temple (Lk 2:41–50). Joseph, a carpenter (Mt 13:55), apparently taught his trade to Jesus (Mk 6:3). Joseph seems to have died before Jesus began His ministry, as seems evident from the fact that it was His mother and brothers who visited Him (Mt 12:46), and His brothers who attempted to advise Him (Jn 7:3–5) also Jesus’ request that the disciple John take care of His mother would hardly have been made if her husband had still been alive (ch 19:26, 27).</article>

    <shortdescription>The son of Herod the Great, a ruler of Galilee and Perea during Jesus' ministry. In the Bible he is called "Herod the Tetrarch". John the Baptist speaks to him about his adulterous relationship with Herodias who cannot rest until John is dead.</shortdescription>
    <article>Herod (Antipas) Ruler of Galilee and Perea during Jesus’ ministry, called "Herod the Tetrarch" in the New Testament, but usually referred to in history as "Herod Antipas." He was the son of Herod the Great and his Samaritan wife Malthace, and was educated in Rome with his brother Archelaus and his half brother Philip. Antipas was designated successor to the throne in his father’s 2nd will, yet in Herod’s final will he was given only Galilee and Perea, with the title of tetrarch. Mark refers to him by his popular title, king (ch 6:14). Since he is simply called Herod in the Gospels, a name found also on his coins, readers of the Bible have frequently confused him with his father. He was married to the daughter of Aretas IV, king of the Nabataeans, whose capital was Petra, south of the Dead Sea (The Roman Empire in the First Century (A.D.)). This marriage may have been contracted with the purpose of making the eastern and southern borders of Perea safe from Nabataean attacks.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
During a visit to Rome, Herod Antipas fell in love with Herodias, his niece, who was the wife of his half brother, Herod Philip. Herodias thereupon left her husband and lived with Antipas. His discarded wife’s father was deeply offended and consequently waged war against Antipas, in which he succeeded in occupying parts of Antipas’ Transjordan territories. John the Baptist severely rebuked Antipas (perhaps publicly) for his adultery and as a result was incarcerated in Machaerus, a fortress east of the Dead Sea. Herodias deeply hated John for his interference in her private life and could not rest until she brought about his death (Mt 14:1–12). Antipas was known for his cunning (Jesus called him "that fox," Lk 13:32), his ambitions, and his love of luxuries, yet he lived as an orthodox Jew, and went to Jerusalem on feast days (ch 23:7). For years he was an enemy of Pilate (v 12), because he could not condone the procurator’s anti-Jewish acts. In harmony with the Jewish aversion to images he refrained from having his portrait put on his coins. He rebuilt Sepphoris in Galilee, added to its fortifications, and made it his capital. He also built Tiberias and other cities and strengthened the borders of his domain.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Herod Antipas is mentioned in the New Testament in connection with the imprisonment and execution of John the Baptist (Mt 14:3–12). He may have planned to arrest and kill Jesus of Nazareth, as the Pharisees claimed (Lk 13:31), but this is not certain. He considered Jesus to be the risen Baptist (Mk 6:14–16). When he finally met Jesus in Jerusalem, he showed interest in Him, but his interest turned to ridicule when Jesus refused to answer him (Lk 23:8–12). Pilate’s act of sending Jesus to him, in recognition of Herod’s authority over Galileans even in Jerusalem, resulted in a friendship between the two former antagonists. In a.d. 37 Agrippa, Herodias’ brother, was made king over the northeastern territories of Palestine that Philip (see Herod, 4) had held. Herodias, dissatisfied that her husband had the title only of tetrarch, induced him to go with her to Rome and to seek a royal crown from Caligula. Agrippa, however, sent letters to Rome accusing his uncle Antipas of treasonable activities. As a result, instead of being made a king, Herod was banished in a.d. 39, to either Gaul or Spain, where Herodias followed him into exile. His territory was added to that of his accuser, Agrippa.</article>

    <shortdescription>An angel told Joseph not to "put away" Mary for "that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit" (Matt. 1:20). Luke writes that the angel said, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you" (1:35).</shortdescription>
    <article>On the incarnation of Christ, the Bible speaks of His mother Mary. Jesus was made "in the likeness of sinful flesh" (Rom. 8:3). Mary was as much in need of salvation from her sins as any other son or daughter of Adam (Rom. 3:10, 23). There is but "one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus" (1 Tim. 2:5).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Espoused to Joseph. That is, betrothed, or engaged, to him. Both Mary and Joseph were living in Nazareth (Luke 1:26, 27 2:4), "their own city" (Luke 2:39), though, as descendants of David, they considered Bethlehem their ancestral home. The fact that they found lodging in Bethlehem only with difficulty suggests that neither of them had close relatives living there at the time. Both Joseph and Mary were of the house and lineage of David (Matt. 1:20 Luke 1:26, 27 2:4 see on Matt. 1:16). They were probably members of the small circle that eagerly studied the prophecies and looked for the coming of the Messiah. If so, knowing that the time was near, they, like other members of this group, no doubt prayed that God would hasten His coming. It seems that Joseph was a widower at the time of his marriage to Mary. He had other children (Matt. 12:46 13:55, 56 Mark 6:3), all probably older than Jesus.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Before they came together. Matthew has already indicated that Joseph was not the father of Jesus (v. 16). Here, he reaffirms the fact. During the time of betrothal the prospective bride and groom were bound legally as husband and wife though they did not live together (Deut. 22:23, 24). Betrothal constituted a legal relationship, a solemn covenant that could be broken only by legal means, that is, by divorce.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Found with child. See Luke 1:26–38. The angel had appeared to Mary after her betrothal (Luke 1:26, 27), but prior to the time of her conception (Luke 1:31, 35). Of the visit of the angel to Mary, Joseph apparently knew nothing till later. The appearance of the angel to Joseph did not occur until he already knew that Mary was "with child" (Matt. 1:18, 20).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Holy Ghost. Better, "Holy Spirit." "Ghost" is from an old Anglo-Saxon word. The expressions translated "Holy Ghost" and "Holy Spirit" (Luke 11:13 etc.) are identical in the Greek. The Holy Ghost is represented as the Agent through whom the creative and life-giving power of God is exercised (cf. Gen. 1:2 Job 33:4 John 3:3–8 Rom. 8:11 etc.). The role of the Holy Spirit in the birth of Jesus is more clearly stated by Luke than by Matthew (Luke 1:35). It was by the agency of the Holy Spirit that "the Word was made flesh" (John 1:14), and that the Son of Mary could be called the "Son of God" (see on Luke 1:35).&lt;BR /&gt;
In an endeavor to discredit Jesus as the Messiah, the Jews manufactured the fiction that He was an illegitimate child (John 8:41 9:29). But it is worthy of note that the most learned Jewish scholars today recognize that story to be sheer invention. Joseph Klausner, for instance, says that "there is no historical foundation for the tradition of Jesus’ illegitimate birth" (Jesus of Nazareth, p. 36).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The incarnation of Jesus is a sublime and unfathomable miracle. He was "in the form of God" (Phil. 2:6 John 1:2), adored by the heavenly hosts and seated upon the throne of the universe. But as the King of glory He chose to "give back the scepter into the Father’s hands", that He might "for a little while" be made "lower than the angels" (Heb. 2:7, 8, RSV), "in the likeness of men" (Phil. 2:7). Afterward, He would again receive "all power" (Matt. 28:18), be "enthroned amidst the adoration of the angels", and be crowned "with glory and honor" (Heb. 2:7, RSV see also Isa. 52:13–15). The mystery of the incarnation, however, is far surpassed by the mystery of the condescending love that prompted it (John 3:16 Rom. 5:8 Gal. 2:20 1 John 4:9). The "mystery of godliness" is the grand ministry of all time (1 Tim. 3:16).</article>

    <article>Jesus Christ. [Gr. Iesous (a transliteration of the Aramaic Yeshûa‘ from the Heb. Yehôshûa‘, "Joshua," meaning "Yahweh is salvation"), Christos (a translation of the Heb.

It expressed the parents’ faith in God and in His promise of One who would bring salvation to Israel. &lt;BR /&gt;

The angel Gabriel instructed Joseph to call Mary’s first-born by this name, the reason given being, "He shall save his people from their sins" (Mt 1:21). "Christ" was not a personal name by which people knew Him while on earth, but a title used to identify Him as the One in whom the Messianic promises and prophecies of the Old Testament met their fulfillment. To those who believed in Him as sent of God He was the Christ, that is, the Messiah, the One "anointed" by God to be the Saviour of the world. When used together, as in Mt 1:18 16:20 Mk 1:1, the two names Jesus and Christ constitute a confession of faith that Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of Mary, is indeed the Christ, the Messiah (Mt 1:1 Acts 2:38). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
He was also to be known by the title Emmanuel, "God with us," in recognition of His deity and virgin birth (Mt 1:23 cf. Is 7:14 9:6, 7). Christ’s usual designation for Himself was "the Son of man" (Mk 2:10 etc.), an expression never used by others when speaking of or to Him. By this title, which seems to have Messianic implications, Jesus emphasized His humanity, doubtless thinking of Himself as the promised Seed of Gen 3:15 22:18 cf. Gal 3:16. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jesus seldom used the title "Son of God," which stresses deity, of Himself (Jn 9:35–37, KJV 10:36), though He often referred to God as His Father (Mt 16:17 etc.). However, the Father called Him His Son (Lk 3:22 9:35), and John the Baptist (Jn 1:34) and the Twelve (Mt 14:33 16:16), "Son of God."  It was Jesus’ claim that God was His Father in a special sense, and later His admission that He was the Son of God, that the Jews seized upon as warranting His condemnation and death (Lk 22:70, 71). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Gabriel explained that Jesus was to be called the Son of God by virtue of His birth to Mary by the power of the Holy Ghost (Lk 1:35 cf. Heb 1:5), and Paul declared that Jesus’ resurrection from the dead designated Him "Son of God" in power (Rom 1:4, RSV). His disciples frequently addressed Him as "Master" (Mk 4:38 9:38 etc.), and eventually, in recognition of His deity, as "Lord" (Jn 14:5, 8 20:28). The term "son of David" was a popular Messianic designation used by rulers and people alike (Mt 12:23 22:42 Mk 12:35 etc.) as an expression of hope for deliverance from political oppression.</article>

    <shortdescription>Name means "stone" or "rock." He is the son of Jona (John). His original name was Simon until Jesus changed it to Peter. He is one of the 12 apostles of Jesus. A man of action, he could be boastful and impulsive. He is crucified in Rome upside down.</shortdescription>
    <article>Peter (pe`ter). [Gr. Petros, "stone," a translation of the Aramaic Kêpha’, "Cephas," "rock," or "stone." See Jn 1:42.] One of the Twelve, also called Simon (Gr. Simon and Sumeon, from Heb. Shim‘ôn, "Simeon"), a son of Jona (Jn 1:42), or, on the basis of textual evidence, John (see chs 1:42 21:15–17 RSV). Peter’s name appears 1st in all 4 New Testamentlists of the Twelve (Mt 10:2 Mk 3:16 Lk 6:14 Acts 1:13). Jesus gave Simon his new name, Peter, when Peter’s brother, Andrew, first brought him to Christ (Jn 1:40–42). Peter was thus the 1st Christian convert resulting from what might be called a layman’s efforts. His eagerness, earnestness, courage, vigor, and organizing ability apparently earned him a place of leadership among the disciples from the very beginning. He was preeminently a man of action, and his enthusiastic disposition was his outstanding character trait. He was also a man of pronounced extremes, possessing marked virtues and serious defects—seemingly contradictory traits of character that existed side by side. He was usually warm-hearted, generous, bold, and daring, but again he might be selfish, boastful, impulsive, or reckless. In a moment of crisis he might prove to be weak, cowardly, and vacillating, and no one could ever be sure which side of his character and personality would prevail.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Peter was a native of Bethsaida Julias (see Jn 1:44 Jos. Ant. xviii. 2. 1), on the northeastern shore of the Sea of Galilee, and was a fisherman by occupation (Mt 4:18). He was married (Mt 8:14 1 Cor 9:5) and lived with his family at Capernaum, where Jesus, on one occasion, restored Peter’s mother-in-law to health (Mt 8:5, 14 Mk 1:29–31 Lk 4:31, 38). On the night of the betrayal he was foremost in professing loyalty to the Saviour (Mt 26:33), but also the first to deny his Master and confirm his thrice-repeated denial with an oath (vs 69–74). Realizing, too late, what he had done, he "went out, and wept bitterly" (v 75). After the resurrection the first of the twelve to whom Jesus appeared was Peter (Lk 24:34 1 Cor 15:5), and early one morning when Jesus met with His disciples by the shores of Galilee, Peter was the first ashore to greet his Master (Jn 21:7). Upon this occasion Jesus gave Peter a threefold opportunity to confess his faith and love, and thus to remove any lingering doubt in the minds of his fellow disciples as to his loyalty (vs 15–17). Thereupon Jesus foretold Peter’s death as a martyr (vs 18, 19) and a few moments later rebuked his inquisitiveness as to John’s fate (vs 21–24).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
At Pentecost, fully converted, Peter delivered the great sermon recorded in the 2nd chapter of Acts (vs 14–36), an inspired address that led some 3,000 to believe in Jesus as the Messiah (v 41). Together with John, Peter healed the lame man at the Gate Beautiful (ch 3:1–11), and later, surrounded by a throng in the Temple, eloquently testified to the death, resurrection, and power of Christ (vs 12–26). He was arrested for healing the lame man, and when brought before the Sanhedrin for an investigation, he again boldly testified concerning Jesus (ch 4:1–12), and when commanded not to speak further in the name of Jesus, Peter and John declared that they could not "but speak the things" which they had "seen and heard" (vs 19, 20). He glorified God by a martyr’s death (cf. Jn 21:18, 19). Peter’s 1st epistle was written from the city of Rome (see 1 Pe 5:13, where Babylon is undoubtedly used as a cryptic name for Rome), in which he seems to have labored for a while shortly before his martyrdom, at about the time Paul sealed his testimony with his blood. According to tradition, he was crucified with his head downward, at Rome, about a.d. 67.</article>

    <shortdescription>John, the son of Zebedee, and brother of James was a disciple of Jesus and a member of His inner circle. Jesus entrusted him with the care of His mother at the cross. John was banished to Patmos. He wrote a gospel, three epistles, and Revelation.</shortdescription>
    <article>Name means "Yahweh is gracious". A son of Zebedee, and apparently Salome, and brother of James (Mt 4:21; 27:56; cf. Mk 15:40; 16:1; Jn 19:25; Acts 12:1, 2). The fact that James is usually mentioned first when the names of the 2 disciples appear together implies that John was the younger of the two. Zebedee and his 2 sons were fishermen by trade, and apparently reasonably prosperous (Mk 1:19, 20). John apparently enters the Gospel narrative in Jn 1:35–40 as an unnamed disciple, among the throng listening to John the Baptist by the river Jordan. In that case he and Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, were the first of John the Baptist’s disciples to follow Jesus. John apparently returned with Jesus to Galilee a few days later and attended the wedding festivities at Cana (ch 2:1–11). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
John was with Jesus intermittently during the next year, the period of His Judean ministry, but also evidently devoted part of his time to the fishing business; but as Jesus began His Galilean ministry, He invited John and his brother, and Peter and Andrew as well, to become permanent disciples (Lk 5:1–11). Some months later John was among the 12 chosen to be apostles (Mt 10:2). Henceforth John was intimately associated with Jesus in His labors. With Peter and James, John was a member of Jesus’ inner circle of associates. He witnessed the raising of Jairus’ daughter (Mk 5:37), and was present at the Transfiguration (ch 9:2) and again at Gethsemane (ch 14:33). John gave evidence of an impetuous disposition upon various occasions, as when he rebuked someone who labored in Christ’s name but had not formally become a disciple (Lk 9:49), and when he proposed to call fire down from heaven on the inhabitants of a Samaritan village who had refused Christ the privilege of sleeping in their village (vs 52–56). He revealed selfishness upon the occasion when he with his brother sought places of honor beside Jesus in His future kingdom, but also demonstrated zeal and loyalty by declaring himself ready to face death with his Master (Mt 20:20–24; Mk 10:35–41).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
During his association with Jesus, John seems to have yielded himself fully to the softening, subduing influence of the Saviour, with the result that his character was transformed. Apparently he entered into a fellowship with Jesus deeper and richer than that of the other apostles (see Jn 21:20). At the Last Supper he occupied the place next to Jesus (ch 13:23). When Jesus was arrested in Gethsemane, John followed Him into the palace of the high priest, where he seems to have been known, and later to Calvary (chapters 18:15; 19:26). At the cross Jesus entrusted His mother Mary to the loving care of John (ch 19:27). Early Sunday morning, upon hearing the report that Jesus’ tomb was empty, John and Peter ran together to the sepulcher to investigate, and became witnesses of the fact that Jesus had indeed risen (ch 20:1–10). John was present the evening of the day of the resurrection, when Jesus appeared to the disciples in the upper room, and also a week later (Lk 24:33–43; Jn 20:19–30; 1 Cor 15:5). He was one of a group of disciples who had gone fishing, to whom Jesus appeared on the shores of Galilee (Jn 21:1-7).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
After the ascension John remained with the other 10 apostles in the upper room at Jerusalem (Acts 1:13), and subsequently joined with Peter in missionary labor in the city of Jerusalem (ch 3:1). Despite imprisonment, both apostles witnessed boldly to their faith in Jesus (ch 4:19). Later Peter and John went to Samaria to assist Philip (ch 8:14). John was possibly among the "apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem" for a number of years (see Acts 16:4; Gal 2:9). Tradition, supported by the implication in Rev 1:11, suggests that during the later years of his life John was in charge of the churches in the Roman province of Asia Minor, with headquarters at Ephesus. From there he was banished by Domitian to the island of Patmos (v 9) but is thought to have been released when Nerva became emperor in a.d. 96 . According to tradition, Polycarp, Papias, and Ignatius were pupils of John. Following his release, according to tradition, John resided at Ephesus, and died during the reign of Trajan, a.d. 98–117. Toward the close of his life John wrote the book of Revelation and also the Gospel and the three epistles that bear his name.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Paul, the great apostle to the Gentiles is introduced in the book of Acts as Saul who persecuted the church. After his conversion on the road to Damascus he carries the gospel to non-Jews, raising up many new churches in Asia Minor.</shortdescription>
    <article>Name means "little," or "small." The great apostle to the Gentiles. He is introduced in the Bible as Saul (Gr. Saulos, from the Heb. Sha’ûl, "asked [of God]," or "lent [to God]" Acts 7:58) and is referred to by that name in the narrative of the book of Acts through ch 13:9. There has been considerable speculation as to why, halfway through the book of Acts, Saul is abruptly referred to as Paul, and is called by that name exclusively from that point on, except when he himself relates the story of his conversion (chapters 22:7, 13 26:14). A simple and plausible answer is that he, like others (Acts 1:23 13:1 Col 4:11 etc.), had more than one name in his case a Hebrew name, Saul, and a Grecized Roman name, Paulos, or Paul. His Hebrew name was probably commonly used in his home and in his intercourse with Jews. His Greco-Roman name would be in keeping with the Hellenistic influence and environment of the city where he was born, and with his enviable status as a Roman citizen. Later, when he began his work among the Gentiles, it was to his advantage to be known as Paul. It is worthy of note that up to Acts 13 Paul is mentioned only in reference to his contact with the Jews. But in that chapter the record of his activities among the Gentiles begins, as does also the use of his Gentile name, Paul.</article>

    <shortdescription>John the Baptist was a forerunner of Christ, preparing the way for Jesus' ministry. He was rugged in appearance and character and spoke the truth in a straightforward manner. His ministry reached its height when Jesus was baptized.</shortdescription>
    <article>John was about six months older than Jesus, and it is reasonable to think that his ministry began about six months prior to that of Christ. Thus John may have begun in the spring of the same year, perhaps about the Passover season. Great throngs would be approaching or leaving Jerusalem in the vicinity of the very spot where John was preaching. The apt illustrations John used in his preaching imply that the time of the (spring) harvest was not far away.&lt;BR /&gt;
"In those days" the Jews living in Palestine, particularly in Judea, were on the verge of revolution. Since the assignment of Roman procurators to govern Judea in a.d. 6, upon the banishment of Archelaus by Augustus, the presence of Roman officers and soldiers, the exercise of Roman authority, and the resulting influx of heathen customs had resulted in one uprising after another. Thousands of the bravest men of Israel had paid for their patriotism with their blood. Conditions were such that the people longed for a strong leader to deliver them from the cruel bondage of Rome.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
John the Baptist. Jesus said of John that "among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet" (Luke 7:28). He was "more than a prophet" (see on Matt. 11:9). John’s influence with the people eventually became so great that Herod Antipas at first hesitated to harm him (Matt. 14:1, 5 Mark 11:32), and the Jewish leaders did not dare speak openly against him (Matt. 21:26 Luke 20:6). Josephus gives a vivid account of John the Baptist that closely parallels that of the Gospels (Antiquities xviii. 5. 2).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Wilderness of Judaea. This expression generally refers to the rugged, barren hills between the Dead Sea and the crest of the central mountain range of Palestine, a region of little rainfall and few inhabitants. John had spent much of his time as a youth and young man in the wilderness (Luke 1:80). His parents had probably lived in or near Hebron, not far from the western borders of this "wilderness." In New Testamenttimes the term wilderness was used to refer to both the rugged hills west of the Dead Sea and the lower part of the Jordan valley. According to Luke 3:3, John went from place to place, up and down the Jordan valley. Between Jericho and the Dead Sea the wilderness of Judea met that of the Jordan. John’s ministry apparently began in this vicinity.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
John not only proclaims the establishment of the "kingdom of heaven" (v. 2) but announces the imminent arrival of its king. The figure of speech employed represents the preparations to be made in advance of the announced coming of the king. When an Oriental monarch intended to visit parts of his realm he would dispatch messengers to each district to be visited, announcing his anticipated visit and summoning the inhabitants to prepare for his arrival. The local inhabitants of each district were expected to "prepare" the highway over which he would travel, inasmuch as little was ordinarily done to maintain roads. In some Oriental lands it is still customary to repair the roads over which the king or some other celebrity is about to travel.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus comes from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by his cousin, John, to fulfill all righteousness.</shortdescription>
    <article>It was now the autumn of a.d. 27, and John the Baptist had, possibly, been preaching for about six months (see on Matt. 3:1). The autumn was the time of three important festivals: (1) Rosh Hashanah, or the festival of the blowing of the trumpets (see Vol. I, p. 709 see on Lev. 23:24 Num. 29:1) (2) Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement (see Vol. I, pp. 705, 706, 710 see on Ex. 30:10 Lev. 16) (3) the Feast of Tabernacles (see Vol. I, p. 710 see on Ex. 23:16 Lev. 23:34). At the third festival all males were expected to appear before the Lord at Jerusalem (Ex. 23:14–17). Inasmuch as the baptism of Christ occurred in the autumn, it is reasonable to think that it may have been in connection with His presence there at this festal season. When Jesus heard of the message proclaimed by John He recognized His call. This marked the close of His private life in Nazareth and the commencement of His three and a half years of public ministry, from the autumn of a.d. 27 to the spring of a.d. 31.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Though Jesus and John were related by blood, they had had no direct acquaintance. John had heard of the events connected with the birth and childhood of Jesus, and believed Him to be the Messiah. Also, it had been revealed to John that the Messiah would seek baptism at his hands, and that a sign would then be given identifying Him as the Messiah. John was impressed with the perfection of the character of the One standing before him and with his own need as a sinner.</article>

    <shortdescription>After Jesus is baptized He is "led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil." Jesus fasts and prays forty days and nights during this time. He is tempted three times and overcomes by quoting Scripture. He is victorious.</shortdescription>
    <article>From birth Jesus had been under the guidance and instruction of the Holy Spirit (see on Matt. 3:16 Luke 2:52), but at the time of His baptism the Spirit descended upon Him in rich measure to endow Him with wisdom and skill for His appointed mission (Acts 10:38 cf. ch. 1:8). Jesus was "guided, step by step, by the Father’s will," in harmony with "the plan" that "lay out before Him, perfect in all its details," "before He came to earth". Mark uses an even stronger expression, saying, "The spirit driveth him into the wilderness" (Mark 1:12).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The traditional site of the temptation is in the rugged, barren hills that rise to the west of Jericho, called the Quarantania in allusion to the 40 days of Jesus’ stay in the wilderness. The baptism occurred in the Jordan east of Jericho, and the fact that Jesus returned thither at the close of the 40 days implies that the wilderness of temptation was at no great distance. This being the case, it is entirely possible that Jesus retired to the wilderness region in the vicinity of Mt. Nebo in the Mountains of Abarim, east of the Dead Sea. It was from the lofty heights of Mt. Nebo that "the Lord shewed him [Moses] all the land" (Deut. 34:1–4), and it may have been from the same spot, "an exceeding high mountain," that the devil presented to Christ "all the kingdoms of the world" (Matt. 4:8).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The devil always attacks us at our times of greatest weakness, for it is then we are most likely to fall. For this reason it is of vital importance to preserve the physical, mental, and emotional powers at a high level of strength and efficiency. Anything that weakens these powers weakens our defense against the wiles of the tempter. Such things as overwork, lack of exercise, overeating, a faulty diet, lack of sleep, or anything that lessens intellectual alertness and emotional control tends to open the way for the evil one to enter the soul. To entertain thoughts of discouragement, defeat, or resentment will have the same effect.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The prince of this world came to Christ and found nothing in Him that responded, even in the very least degree, to temptation. The Son of God, "in the likeness of sinful flesh, … condemned sin in the flesh" (Rom. 8:3), and if we but come to Him in faith—if we choose to "walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit" (Rom. 8:4)—He will, by His grace, enable us thus to walk. If we will but submit ourselves to God, we too may resist the devil, and he will flee from us (see James 4:7, 8). God will be to us a sure defense (Prov. 18:10).</article>

    <shortdescription>When John the Baptist sees Jesus at the Jordan, he points to Christ and says, "Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!" </shortdescription>
    <article>The delegation from Jerusalem had departed. Evidently they did not take John seriously, or they would have pressed their investigation further, to discover, if possible, of whom he spoke (see v. 26). The preceding day Jesus had not been identified by John’s indirect reference to Him as the Messiah (v. 26). Now He is singled out from the crowd. What a privilege to be the first to herald (see on Matt. 3:1) Jesus, the One to whom all the prophets of old bore witness, as the true sacrifice! Which of the prophets would not have thrilled at the privilege! Little wonder that Jesus later spoke of John as a prophet than whom no greater had arisen in Israel (Luke 7:28)!&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
John alone uses the designation "lamb of God" for Christ, though Luke (Acts 8:32) and Peter (1 Peter 1:19) have similar comparisons (cf. Isa. 53:7). John the Baptist introduced Jesus as "the Lamb of God" to John the evangelist (see on John 1:35, 36), and for the disciple this title must have held deep significance. The figure, which stresses Jesus’ innocence and perfection of character, and thus the vicarious nature of His sacrifice (Isa. 53:4–6, 11, 12 see on Ex. 12:5), is reminiscent of the paschal lamb of Egypt, which typified deliverance from the bondage of sin. "Christ our passover is sacrificed for us" (1 Cor. 5:7). By the figure of a lamb John identifies the suffering Messiah as the one in whom the sacrificial system of OT times reaches reality and has meaning. In the divine foreknowledge and purpose He was "the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world" (Rev. 13:8).</article>

    <shortdescription>After His baptism two disciples hear John speak of Jesus as the "Lamb of God." They follow Him. They are Andrew and Peter. John presumably is the other. Later Philip and Nathanael join as Christ's first disciples.</shortdescription>
    <article>Andrew and John were the first followers. Soon Peter, Philip, and Nathanael (Bartholomew) joined them (see John 1:40, 43, 45 see on Mark 3:16–18). The followers did not at this time permanently discontinue their usual occupation and become disciples in the full sense of the word. Not until more than a year later, in the spring of a.d. 29, did they receive the call to permanent discipleship (see on Luke 5:1, 11). Only then could it be said that "they forsook all, and followed him" (Luke 5:11). The formal appointment of the Twelve came even later, during the summer of the same year (see on Mark 3:14).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
John and Andrew desired to converse with Jesus concerning the declaration of v. 36, "Behold the Lamb of God!" They were not yet thinking of following Him in the formal sense of becoming regular followers (see on v. 43). It was now probably the late autumn or early winter of a.d. 27 (see The Chronology of Luke 3:1, 2). They followed Jesus intermittently for the next year and a half before He issued the call to permanent discipleship (see on Luke 5:11). Jesus’ formal appointment of the Twelve did not take place till the late summer of a.d. 29 (see on Mark 3:13–19). The five who "followed" Jesus at the Jordan did so simply in the sense of accepting John’s witness to His Messiahship.</article>

    <shortdescription>At a wedding feast in Cana Jesus performs His first miracle. The host runs out of wine. Jesus invites them to fill six water stone pots with water. He then instructs someone to take a cup to the host who finds it to be the best grape juice ever.</shortdescription>
    <article>While attending a wedding feast in Cana, the wine ran out. Mary’s confidence in coming to Jesus with the problem is worthy of note. As a dutiful son Jesus had always been attentive to her desires, and had found an appropriate solution to every problem. Whether Mary expected Jesus to perform a miracle, which He had not done before (see v. 11), is not clear from the Gospel narrative. Possibly the presence of Jesus and His disciples had attracted a crowd.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jesus spoke respectfully to His mother. That Mary did not understand Jesus’ reply as a refusal is evident from her instructions to the servants (see John 2:5). She was satisfied that Jesus would supply the need in His own good time and way. Throughout His private life in Nazareth, Jesus had honored the authority of His mother in fact He ever remained a dutiful son in the sphere where that relationship properly prevailed. But now He was no longer a private individual, and Mary did not appreciate fully the limits this placed on her authority over Jesus. She might feel she had the right, in some degree at least, to direct Him in His mission. Accordingly, in these clear-cut but courteous words Jesus sought to make clear to her the distinction between His relation to her as the Son of man and as the Son of God. His love for her was unchanged, but now He must labor from day to day under the direction of His heavenly Father.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Mary apparently hoped that Jesus would, upon this occasion, proclaim Himself the Messiah, but the time for such an announcement had not arrived. There was an appointed time for each event in His life. Not until the very close of His ministry did Jesus publicly claim to be the Messiah, and because of this claim He was crucified. Not until the night of the betrayal did Jesus say, "My time is at hand" (Matt. 26:18).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When Christ turned water into wine, this miracle provided the early disciples with the first visible evidence of divine power working through Christ, fortified them against the unbelief and antipathy of the Jewish leaders, and provided them with their first opportunity to testify to their new-found faith. Also, it honored Mary’s trust. In a practical way it expressed the sympathetic interest of Jesus in human happiness.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Christ and His disciples attend Passover, the first of three annual pilgrimage festivals held in early spring. Jesus cleanses the Temple by driving out the money changers. He overturns their tables and also drives out the animals.</shortdescription>
    <article>This was Jesus’ First Cleansing of the Temple, His first act of national importance. By it He declared His right to administer the affairs of the Temple and announced His mission as the Messiah. The second cleansing occurred three years later, at the fourth Passover as a reminder that His claim was still valid. When Jesus drove out the money exchangers, He used a scourge or, "whip." Jesus did not actually strike the people. The whip was symbolic of His authority, and a flourish in the air would suffice to make His intention clear. No whip is mentioned in connection with the second cleansing.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Christ spoke of the Temple as His Father's house. The Temple was God’s dwelling place among men. Again and again the Jews criticized Jesus for speaking of God as His Father. They also claimed God as their Father (ch. 8:41), but realized that Jesus did so in a higher sense. They perceived that, in these words, Jesus set forth an unqualified claim to divinity. At the second cleansing Jesus spoke of the Temple as "my house" (Matt. 21:13), and when the leaders rejected His final appeal the following day He referred to it as "your house" (Matt. 23:38). Christ spoke against the Temple being a house of merchandise, that is, a market place, a place for the transaction of common business. At the second cleansing He used the expression "den of thieves" (see Matt. 21:13). Those today who conscientiously seek to make their Father’s house a "house of prayer" (Matt. 21:13) will avoid making it a place for common thoughts, words, or actions. They will enter His house with awe and reverence, conscious of His holy presence, heart and mind uplifted in prayer and praise.</article>

    <shortdescription>In a nighttime visit, Nicodemus requests an interview with Jesus. He is a Pharisee and member of the Sanhedrin, a great teacher in Israel. Christ comes directly to the point and tells him, "You must be born again."</shortdescription>
    <article>Nicodemus was a man of wealth, a Pharisee, and a member of the national council, the Sanhedrin. The interview with Nicodemus illustrates the statement of ch. 2:25, that Jesus "knew what was in man" (see on ch. 3:3). He recognized in this leader a sincere seeker for truth, one to whom He could "commit" a clearer and more complete knowledge of His mission than He could to most men (ch. 2:24). Nicodemus was a noteworthy exception to the general principle stated in ch. 2:24, 25. Thus, at the very beginning of His public ministry, Jesus won a friend whose influence providentially thwarted the plans of the leaders to bring His labors to an untimely close.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This visit took place on the Mount of Olives, probably not long after the First Cleansing of the Temple, recorded in ch. 2:13–17. Nicodemus had witnessed that dramatic incident and had no doubt heard Jesus and witnessed some of His miracles (ch. 2:23). He certainly shared with other Jews the hope for a political Messiah who would free the nation from the shackles of Rome (see on Luke 4:19), and must have been perplexed as Jesus explained the spiritual nature of His kingdom. Nicodemus was cautious by nature, and did not openly declare himself a follower of the humble Nazarene until after the crucifixion. The seed planted upon this occasion fell on fertile ground, eventually to bring forth a bountiful harvest.</article>

    <shortdescription>As Jesus travels from Judea to Galilee, He and His disciples pass through Samaria. Around noon while the disciples go to find food, Jesus meets a Samaritan woman at Jacob's well and tells her about living water. She witnesses to the whole village.</shortdescription>
    <article>While traveling through Samaria on the way to Galilee, Jesus' disciples stop at a well to rest. While the disciples are in town purchasing food, Christ witnesses to a Samaritan woman. The process of winning the woman of Samaria deserves the most careful study on the part of all who set out to win others to Christ. There were four main stages in this process: (1) The awakening of a desire for something better, vs. 7–15. (2) The awakening of a conviction of personal need, vs. 16–20. (3) The call for a decision to acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah, vs. 21–26. (4) The stimulus to action appropriate to the decision, vs. 28–30, 39–42. For comment on the detailed steps in each of these four stages of the process see on vs. 7, 16, 21, 28.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jesus gained the woman’s attention with the request, "Give me to drink." Her response is evident in the question of v. 9, "How is it …?" Having thus secured her undivided attention, Jesus aroused her interest by the offer of "living water" (v. 10). Her reaction appears in the question as to "whence" He obtained such water (v. 11) and whether He professed to be "greater" than Jacob, who had dug the well (v. 12). From attention and interest, Jesus led her on to desire the "living water," declaring that those who drink it will "never thirst" (v. 14). She responded with the request, "Sir, give me this water" (v. 15), even though she had little conception, as yet, of what she was asking for.</article>

    <shortdescription>One day Jesus passes a crowd that has gathered around a pool in Jerusalem seeking to be healed. He sees a man who has not walked for 38 years. Christ approaches him and asks, "Do you want to be made well?" He then heals the man.</shortdescription>
    <article>The miracle healing of the invalid by the pool of Bethesda and the arraignment of Jesus before the Sanhedrin that resulted (see vs. 16–18) mark the close of the Judean ministry. It was now probably the Passover of a.d. 29, a year after the First Cleansing of the Temple (see John 2:13). The Judean ministry thus occupied about one year, having been interrupted temporarily by the withdrawal to Galilee mentioned in ch. 4:1–3.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
A man who had been disabled for 38 years was lying on a mat when Jesus walked by. This statement is an important testimony to the truly miraculous nature of Jesus’ healing, for it precludes any possibility that the man could have been suffering from a temporary disability. For similar statements regarding other miracles see Luke 13:1 Acts 4:22. This invalid sat alone and friendless, a hopeless, paralyzed cripple. His case was the worst of those assembled on the brink of the pool. Christ asks him if he wished to be healed. Too great emphasis on the function of the will implied in this question should be avoided, for the Greek conveys the simple sense, "Do you wish to be healed?" Jesus’ question was rhetorical, for it was obvious that the man desired release from his disease, but it served to turn the sufferer’s attention immediately to Jesus and to the problem of healing from his affliction.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jesus tells the man to rise. His words here are strikingly similar to those in Mark 2:11. Their terseness and directness must have inspired confidence in the sick man. Jesus apparently made no attempt to refute the superstition regarding the pool, nor did He question the causes of the man’s disease. Rather, by a positive approach He enjoined the man to demonstrate his faith. He immediately responds and takes up his bed and walks. It is the Sabbath and when the Jewish leaders see the man carrying his bed on Sabbath, they confront him. Christ later seeks him out and speaks to him, encouraging him to sin no more.</article>

    <shortdescription>After He heals a man by the pool of Bethesda on the Sabbath, the Jewish leaders are very angry at Christ for breaking the law. Jesus speaks to them and says He does nothing of His own will, but only God's will.</shortdescription>
    <article>After healing an invalid on Sabbath Jesus was haled before the Sanhedrin and charged with Sabbathbreaking and to this charge was added that of blasphemy (v. 18). The leaders of the nation sought to counteract Jesus’ undeniably great influence over the people. Also, they set spies to watch Him, apparently to build up a case, so that they could condemn Him to death.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
By their action in publicly censuring Jesus in the spring of a.d. 29 the Jewish leaders sought to undermine His authority and influence with the people. They made a public proclamation warning the nation against Him and set spies to follow Him in an endeavor to find cause for legal action against Him. In the full knowledge that their opposition to Him was without excuse they became even more bitter toward Him from now on, and began laying plans how they might take His life. This design they succeeded in carrying out two years later, at the Passover of a.d. 31.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
By the spring of a.d. 29 they had ample evidence of his Messiahship—they knew of the vision of Zacharias (Luke 1:5–20), of the announcement to the shepherds (Luke 2:8–12), of the coming of the wise men (Matt. 2:1, 2), of the visit of Jesus to the Temple at the age of 12 (Luke 2:42–50), of the witness of John the Baptist to Christ as the Messiah (John 1:19–34). More recently they had had the additional evidence of the perfection evident in Jesus’ character, of the soundness of His teachings, and of the divine character of His miracles. Added to all of this they had the prophecies. These, the Jews must have been impressed were being fulfilled in events then taking place.</article>

    <shortdescription>After passing through Samaria, Jesus comes to Galilee and is welcomed. People saw His works in Jerusalem and are glad to have Him in their area. During this time Christ heals a nobleman's son.</shortdescription>
    <article>As Jesus journeys into Galilee He is approached by a man who seeks healing for his son. The "nobleman" is literally, "king’s [man]," that is, a royal official, here probably a courtier of Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea. This "nobleman" was a Jew, probably a Herodian (cf. on Mark 3:6). Some have suggested identifying this "nobleman" with Chuza (Luke 8:3) or Manaen (Acts 13:1), officials of Herod who became Christians. Christ and the "nobleman" were in Cana, and the son at Capernaum, some 16 mi. (25 km.) distant. Jesus had visited Capernaum approximately one year prior to this time (ch. 2:12), but there is no record of any public work conducted there at that time.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The rapid spread of the report of Jesus’ return to Galilee testifies to His popularity. The nobleman's approach to Christ is the first recorded instance of a request for healing, though miracles in general have already been mentioned (ch. 2:23). His son was at the point of death. Human wisdom and skill could do no more, and as a final resort the father made the trip to Cana in the hope of persuading Jesus to return immediately with him to Capernaum (see v. 49). Finding Jesus surrounded by a throng of people, the father arranged for a private interview with Him.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The father had made his acceptance of Jesus as the Messiah (see v. 45) conditional on the granting of his request, thinking that Jesus would the more readily comply in order to secure a "nobleman" as an adherent. But Jesus detected the note of insincerity in the nobleman’s manner of speech and bearing, and realized that his faith was imperfect. To be sure, he already had a measure of faith, or he would not have come at all. But faith such as his is far from perfect, and Jesus always required unquestioning and unconditional faith before divine power could be exercised.</article>

    <shortdescription>After Jesus hears that John the Baptist was put in prison, Christ goes to Galilee. He begins to preach, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."</shortdescription>
    <article>Something of the success of Jesus’ early Judean ministry is apparent from the complaint of John’s disciples that "all men come to him" (John 3:26), and from John’s reply, "He must increase, but I must decrease" (ch. 3:30). In spite of Christ’s apparent popularity and success His Judean ministry bore little fruit. Though the brief remarks of John constitute our sum of information of what took place during this period, it is clear that a considerable period of time was thus occupied. Evidently (John 3:22–24) John the Baptist and Jesus were both preaching in Judea during this time, and that the tide of popularity was gradually ebbing from John and flowing toward Jesus.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The rejection of Jesus by the Sanhedrin after the healing at Bethesda (John 5:16, 18) brought His work in Judea to a close and led to His departure for Galilee and to the formal commencement of His ministry there. Another contributing factor was the recent imprisonment of John the Baptist (Matt. 4:12 Mark 1:14 see on John 4:1). It is interesting to note that the imprisonment of John the Baptist coincide approximately with Jesus’ rejection by the Jewish leaders and the close of His early Judean ministry, and that John’s death came about a year later, shortly before the crisis that brought Christ’s work in Galilee to a close. It was John’s imprisonment, together with His own rejection by the Jewish leaders, that led Jesus to withdraw to Galilee and carry on His work there.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Being at some distance from Jerusalem, and thus less subject to the influence of the religious leaders there, the Jews of Galilee were more simple-hearted and open-minded. They were less under the control of religious prejudice than were their fellow countrymen in Judea. They were more earnest and sincere, and more ready to listen to the message of Christ without bias. In fact, their eagerness to hear what He had to say made it necessary at times for Him to go from place to place, lest enthusiasm rise to such a pitch as to be construed by the authorities as endangering the peace and security of the nation.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus goes to His hometown of Nazareth and enters the synagogue on the Sabbath. After reading from Isaiah He tells the group that the prophecy has been fulfilled in their hearing. The leaders are filled with wrath and seek to push him off a cliff.</shortdescription>
    <article>This was Christ’s first visit to Nazareth since He had left the carpenter shop in the autumn of 27 a.d. to take up His public ministry. It was now probably the late spring of a.d. 29, and nearly half the period of His public ministry was in the past. A year later, probably in the early spring of a.d. 30, Jesus paid His next, and final visit to this city. The first visit is recorded only in vs. 16–30 for the second, see Mark 6:1–6. Here in Nazareth the mother, brothers, and sisters of Jesus still lived and were no doubt among the worshipers in the synagogue on this particular Sabbath.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Christ was in the habit of attending the regular synagogue services on the Sabbath day. Often as a youth in this very synagogue at Nazareth He had been called upon to read the lesson from the prophets, and from His intimate knowledge of the Scriptures He had drawn forth lessons that thrilled the hearts of the worshipers. It seems that Jesus often made use of the opportunity afforded by the assembling of the people at the synagogues of Judea and Galilee, to teach them even as Paul later did in foreign lands (Acts 13:14, 15, 42).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Luke’s simple statement that Jesus habitually attended the sacred synagogue services on the Sabbath day, which he specifically identifies as the seventh day of the week (chs. 23:56 to 24:1), makes clear the duty of the Christian who loves his Master and would follow in His steps (see John 14:15 1 Peter 2:21). The fact that Christ, when here on earth, personally observed the same day of the week as did the Jews, is also evidence that time had not been lost since the giving of the law at Sinai, or for that matter since creation. Christ is "Lord also of the sabbath" (Mark 2:28) that is, He made it (Gen. 2:1–3 cf. Mark 2:27) and claims it as His day. His example in observing it is therefore a perfect pattern for the Christian to follow, both as to the time and as to the manner of its observance. Furthermore, there can be no question but that the week as we have it now has come down in unbroken sequence from the time of Christ, and that observance of the seventh day of the week today is observance of the Sabbath as Christ kept it. From that day to this there have been millions of Jews scattered throughout the civilized world, and it would have been impossible for all of them simultaneously to make identically the same mistake in figuring the seventh day of the week.</article>

    <shortdescription>After Jesus' first rejection in Nazareth, He goes to Capernaum, which is a fulfillment of prophecy in Isaiah 9 and Isaiah 42.</shortdescription>
    <article>After Christ's rejection at Nazareth, He turned to Capernaum, the chief Jewish center of the region (cf. ch. 11:23). Being situated on one of the main highways from Damascus, with Tyre and Sidon on the north, Jerusalem on the south, and the Mediterranean on the west, Capernaum became an important toll station. There was, as well, maritime trade with Decapolis, to the south of the territory of Philip. Perhaps Capernaum was not so large as Sepphoris, which, at least before the building of Tiberias, was the chief city in Galilee. It is thought that Capernaum did not exist before the Babylonian exile if it did, it must have been an insignificant village, for it is not mentioned in the OT.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Capernaum formed an ideal center from which news of the teachings and miracles of Jesus would spread rapidly to all parts of Galilee, and beyond. The healing of the nobleman’s son (see John 4:46–54) the preceding winter (a.d. 28–29, see The Ministry of Our Lord) had already kindled a light in Capernaum (see on Luke 4:23). The nobleman and his entire family were converted and no doubt spread the news of Jesus and of the healing of the son throughout the city, thus preparing the way for Christ’s personal ministry.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jesus made Capernaum His home and headquarters for approximately the next year and a half. Peter had already been following Jesus for more than a year (cf. John 1:40–42), and it seems that he opened his own home to Jesus whenever He was in Capernaum. Capernaum came to be known as "his own city" (Matt. 9:1). It was from this center that Jesus set out on each of His evangelistic tours through the towns of Galilee.</article>

    <shortdescription>As Jesus walks by the Sea of Galilee, He calls two sets of brothers to follow Him. They include Andrew and Peter as well as James and John. They are fishing when He calls them. Jesus says, "I will make you fishers of men." They leave all and follow.</shortdescription>
    <article>It was early morning when Jesus walked by the sea, yet already people were thronging about Him. This fact testifies to His "fame," or popularity, even before the miraculous events of a yet future Sabbath day. Jesus taught the Word of God. His words were gracious, fraught with life-giving power, and the people hungered for them. How their hearts must have thrilled as they listened to Him who was the Word of God incarnate.&lt;BR /&gt;

One of the boats mentioned in the call by the sea belonged to Peter and Andrew the other, to James and John. The four fishermen soon to become fishers of men, together with Zebedee  and two or more "hired servants" (see Mark 1:20), had just returned from their night’s fishing expedition (see Luke 5:5). When Christ calls them to let down their nets again and they obey, an abundant catch is made. They were astonished. Here were the four partners, in possession of the largest catch of fish they had ever brought to shore. At the moment of their greatest material success they abandoned their business. Even in view of the higher significance of the miracle it must have taken a real measure of faith to leave their chosen occupation for an uncertain livelihood as followers of an itinerant teacher who, up to this time, had apparently had small success (DA 245). But in the provision of the abundance of fish, Jesus gave evidence of His power to provide for the needs of His followers, and in humble faith they believed.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
On the part of the disciples there was not the least hesitancy. The decision to dissolve their successful partnership as fishermen for a higher partnership with Jesus as fishers of men was made instantly and intelligently. They needed no time to think things over, no time to provide for the needs of their families (cf. Matt. 8:19–22). They had launched out into the deep as ordinary fishermen when they returned to shore they launched out by faith into the "deep" to which Christ now called them, to fish for men. All night long they had sought in vain to find that with which they proposed to sustain their lives now, for Christ’s sake, they were willing to lose all that life had to offer, and in so doing entered upon a richer, more abundant life (see Matt. 10:39). They took up the cross of service and followed in the footsteps of Jesus (see on Mark 3:14).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Success does not depend so much upon brilliant intellect as upon devotion to Christ and to the task at hand. To be sure, the influence of a person with great talents and superior intelligence will usually be felt in a wider circle, if these talents are consecrated to God. Yet God can dispense with these more easily than He can with a loving heart, a teachable mind, and willing hands. The all-important thing in service for God is that self be put aside and room be made for the working of the Holy Spirit upon the heart.</article>

    <shortdescription>While in Capernaum, Jesus enters the synagogue and is teaching the people when a man appears who is demon possessed. Christ rebukes the demon and it leaves him. All the people are amazed at His authority and power.</shortdescription>
    <article>While teaching in the synagogue of Capernaum one Sabbath a demoniac began to cry out at Jesus. People were listening and astonished at Christ's teaching. The demoniac's interruption occurred at the point where Christ was speaking of His mission to set free those who were slaves of sin and of Satan. In this experience Christ was brought once more face to face with the enemy whom He had defeated in the wilderness of temptation. The audience was listening intently to the message Christ bore, and Satan designed in this way to divert the attention of the people from the truth that was finding fertile ground in at least some of their hearts.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The evil spirit hailed Jesus as One who was in particularly close relationship to God. At other times demons addressed Him as the "Son of God" (Matt. 8:29 Luke 8:28), the very title that led the Jewish leaders to desire His death (John 5:17, 18) and eventually to condemn Him. Jesus "censured" the evil spirit without, however, bringing a "railing accusation" against him (see Jude 9). The rebuke appears to have been administered because the spirit addressed Him as the Messiah. Jesus well knew that an open claim to the Messiahship at this time would only prejudice many minds against Him. Furthermore, the turbulent political situation in Palestine produced many false messiahs, who proposed to lead their countrymen in revolt against Rome and Jesus sought to avoid being considered a political messiah in the popular sense. This would have blinded the people to the true nature of His mission and have offered the authorities a pretext for silencing His labors.</article>

    <shortdescription>After leaving the Capernaum synagogue, Jesus enters Simon Peter's mother-in-law's home where she is sick with a high fever. Jesus rebukes the fever and it leaves her. Then she gets up and serves them.</shortdescription>
    <article>During the Galilean ministry Jesus repeatedly stayed in the house of Simon Peter. His counsel to the Twelve, to remain at one house during their stay in a town (Mark 6:10), doubtless was consistent with His own practice. Peter is the only one of the Twelve specifically mentioned as being married, though in view of the fact that most Jews were married, it has been thought that probably most, if not all, of the other disciples also had wives. The healing of Peter's mother-in-law is the first miracle recorded by all three synoptic writers. Mark’s account provides several details that are lacking in the others. The Bible says Jesus took her by the hand. This act was a personal touch of loving sympathy commonly employed by Jesus (see Matt. 9:25 Mark 5:41 8:23 9:27). Contact with divine power, through faith, made this woman whole. The soul that is sick with sin also needs to feel the touch of a hand that is warm with sympathy.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus begins the first of three tours of ministry in Galilee.</shortdescription>
    <article>Mark open his account of Christ's first missionary tour of Galilee with Jesus preaching. This tour began, probably, in the early summer of a.d. 29. In his writings Josephus names upward of 200 towns and villages in Galilee, and these afforded ample opportunity for an extensive and protracted campaign away from the larger cities clustered along the western shore of the Lake of Galilee. As with the early Judean ministry, concerning which the synoptic writers say little if anything, it is probable that the first missionary tour was more extensive and continued over a longer period of time than the brief attention given it would tend to indicate (see on Mark 2:1). Mark records only one specific incident on the first tour (ch. 1:40–45), but his summary of the results of the tour (v. 45) points to a successful period of ministry covering several weeks, and perhaps as much as two or three months.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Altogether Jesus conducted three missionary tours in Galilee between the Passover of a.d. and that of a.d. 30, the period of the Galilean ministry. On the first tour it is uncertain whether Jesus had as companions more than the four disciples whom He had recently called by the Lake of Galilee (see Mark 1:16–20). They are the only ones specifically named as being with Jesus the day before His departure from Capernaum (v. 29). Others may have begun to follow Him during the course of the first tour, as the formal appointment of the Twelve took place before the beginning of the second tour (ch. 3:13–19). On this first tour Christ proclaimed the imminent establishment of the "kingdom of God" (Luke 4:43), which was basic to all of His later teaching.</article>

    <shortdescription>After presenting the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus descends and multitudes follow Him. A leper approaches Him and says, "Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean." Jesus touches Him and says, "I am willing be cleansed." The leper is healed.</shortdescription>
    <article>In healing a leper, Jesus broke down prejudices against those with this disease. The Jews popularly regarded leprosy as a divine judgment on sin (to which also they attributed being born blind see John 9:2). They had imbibed an old pagan idea (see an Old Babylonian omen text in Archiv für Orientforshung 18:62 naming certain symptoms, apparently of leprosy, as meaning abandonment by God and man). Hence they made no efforts toward alleviation or cure indeed, they knew no remedy for true leprosy—only isolation.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The leper probably hesitated to approached Jesus. Three great obstacles probably presented themselves to the mind of this afflicted man, any one of which might have been sufficient to make the prospect of healing seem remote, if not impossible. In the first place, as far as is known, there was no record of such a healing since Naaman’s, some 800 years before. A second obstacle, even more formidable, was the popular belief that he was under the curse of God. Would Jesus be willing to heal him? The third obstacle presented a more practical problem. How could he get near enough to Jesus to present his requests? The ritual law strictly forbade him to approach or mingle with others, and wherever Jesus went the people thronged about Him. This effectively barred the suffering man from Jesus’ immediate presence.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When the man asked Jesus to heal him, Jesus touched the leper. He knew that touching a leprous man meant uncleanness nevertheless, He did so boldly. Since no human being could then cure leprosy, the fact that Jesus did implied that He had divine power. This gave the people faith that He was able also to cleanse the soul from sin. Jesus had come to the earth for the specific purpose of cleansing sinners, whose spiritual illness was more deadly than leprosy.</article>

    <shortdescription>While teaching in a house in Capernaum that is crowded with people, the friends of a paralytic remove part of the roof and lower him before Christ who forgives his sins and heals the man.</shortdescription>
    <article>While teaching in a house in Capernaum, a paralytic was brought to Christ for healing. Because the crowd around the house was so thick, his friends carried him up on the roof and removed tiles and let him down. This unusual method of reaching Jesus was the desperate suggestion of the paralytic himself, who feared that, though now so close to Jesus, he might yet lose his opportunity. The way in which Jesus had left Capernaum so unexpectedly (ch. 1:37, 38), had remained away for several weeks, and finally had secluded Himself in the desert (ch. 1:45), probably added to the desperation of this man, who faced the prospect of an early death. Christ rewarded his faith and not only healed him but forgave his sins. This angered the teachers of the law who were listening in on this event. The man who had come into the presence of Jesus with a profound sense of need went away in triumphant joy, while those who came in self-satisfaction, pride, and malice went away "dumb with amazement and overwhelmed with defeat". The spirit in which men approach Jesus determines whether they find in Him a steppingstone to heaven or a stumbling block to destruction (see Matt. 21:44 Luke 2:34 1 Peter 2:8).</article>

    <shortdescription>Matthew, a tax collector, despised by many fellow Jews, especially the Pharisees, is called by Jesus to become a disciple. Christ is less concerned with image and more concerned with saving all people. Matthew leaves all and follows Jesus.</shortdescription>
    <article>Christ called Levi Matthew to be His disciples. Luke uses the name Levi (ch. 5:27), but Matthew in the same story prefers the name Matthew (ch. 9:9). That the two names refer to the same man is indicated further by the fact that Matthew also is called "the publican [taxgatherer]" (ch. 10:3), and by the fact that in their lists of the Twelve, the other Gospels have Matthew and not Levi (Mark 3:18 Luke 6:15 cf. Acts 1:13). It was common for Jews to have more than one name, as Simon Peter and John Mark.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Matthew was a tax collector and his tax office apparently was "by the sea side" (v. 13), and was probably an office at which Herod Antipas collected revenue from caravans and travelers passing along the main highway from Damascus and the East to Ptolemais (Accho) on the Mediterranean (see on Isa. 9:1), or over the Lake of Galilee from the territory of Herod Philip. In popular opinion tax collectors were considered disreputable. Not only were they frequently agents of Roman oppression, they also were often extortioners on their own account, who made use of their official power to oppress and defraud the people. They were hated and despised by all, as social and religious outcasts.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When Christ sees Matthew, He says to him, "Follow Me." The usual language Christ used in extending His invitation to discipleship (see Matt. 4:19 John 1:43). Called upon to make the great decision of his life on a moment’s notice, Matthew was ready such a decision would presuppose his having had previous contact with Jesus. In his heart there must have been already a longing to follow Him. But since he knew full well the attitude of the rabbis toward tax collectors, it doubtless did not occur to him that this great Rabbi would condescend to have him among His disciples. Luke (ch. 5:28) adds that Matthew "left all" in order to follow Jesus he left a profitable business to serve without pay.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus and His disciples walk through a grainfield on Sabbath day. They are hungry and eat some grain. The Pharisees criticize them for breaking the Sabbath. Jesus rebukes them and says He is Lord of the Sabbath and they are not guilty of breaking it.</shortdescription>
    <article>While walking through the corn fields one Sabbath, Jesus and His disciples eat some of the grain and are criticized by the Pharisees for breaking the Sabbath. The word "corn" is literally, "of grain" in this instance almost certainly either wheat or barley. Luke (see ch. 6:1) adds that the disciples began rubbing the barley or wheat in their hands to remove the hulls. The Pharisees approach the group. They are told their actions are not lawful. Upon any other day of the week than the Sabbath the action of the disciples would undoubtedly have passed unchallenged, for OT law specifically provided that a hungry person could eat of the fruit or grain of a field as he passed.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Christ’s approval of what His disciples did here, and His own acts of healing upon the Sabbath day, are often misunderstood by modern writers as proof that He neither observed personally nor taught His disciples to observe the OT laws and regulations in regard to Sabbath observance. Some also assert that the stand Christ took with regard to these matters is to be interpreted as a rejection by Him of the fourth commandment. The facts are that Jesus personally adhered to the requirements of the law of Moses and the Decalogue in every respect and taught His followers to do the same. He repeatedly affirmed the eternally binding nature of the moral law (see Matt. 5:17, 18 John 15:10 etc.), and recognized also the validity of the ritual law of Moses as applicable to Jews at that time (see on Matt. 23:3). Jesus, of course, was a Jew.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
But throughout His ministry on earth Christ was in conflict with the Jewish leaders over the validity of man-made laws and traditions (see on Mark 7:2, 3, 8). Toward these requirements, which apparently many of His contemporaries had come to regard as even more essential to piety than the laws of Moses and the Decalogue, Christ took a position of uncompromising opposition (see on ch. 2:19). The most cursory examination of many of these requirements makes their absurdity evident, yet the Pharisees sternly taught that salvation was to be obtained through the rigorous observance of all these rules. A pious Jew’s life tended to become one endless and vain effort to avoid ceremonial uncleanness, incurred when the least detail of these purely human requirements might have been disobeyed inadvertently. This system of righteousness by works was in mortal conflict with righteousness by faith.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
God did not create man because He had a Sabbath and needed someone to keep it. Rather, an Allwise Creator knew that man, the creature of His hand, needed opportunity for moral and spiritual growth, for character development. He needed time in which his own interests and pursuits should be subordinated to a study of the character and will of God as revealed in nature, and later, in revelation. The seventh-day Sabbath was ordained of God to meet this need. To tamper in any way with the Creator’s specifications as to when and how the day should be observed is tantamount to denying that God knows what is best for the creatures of His hand.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
God ordained that the Sabbath should be a blessing, not a burden, and it is to man’s interest and not his injury to observe it. It was designed to increase his happiness, not to work a hardship on him. Sabbath-keeping does not consist essentially in the petty observance of certain formalities and in abstention from certain pursuits to think of it in this light is to miss completely the true spirit and objectives of Sabbath observance and to engage in the pursuit of righteousness based on works. We refrain from certain tasks, from certain pursuits, from certain topics of thought and conversation, not because that by so doing we think to win favor with God. We refrain from these things in order that we may devote our time, our energies, and our thought to other pursuits that will increase our understanding of God, our appreciation of His goodness, our capacity to cooperate with Him, and our ability to serve Him and our fellow men more effectively. Sabbathkeeping that consists only, or primarily, in the negative aspect of not doing certain things is not Sabbathkeeping at all it is only when the positive aspect of Sabbathkeeping is practiced that we may hope to derive from Sabbath observance the benefit ordained by a wise and loving Creator.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The legion requirements of the rabbis pertaining to the meticulous observance of the Sabbath were based on the concept that the Sabbath was of more importance in the sight of God than man himself. According to the apparent reasoning of these blind exponents of the divine law, man was made for the Sabbath—made to keep it mechanically. The rabbis reduced the Sabbath to an absurdity by their rigid and meaningless distinction between what might and what might not be done on that day (see on v. 24). They emphasized the negative aspect of Sabbath observance—of refraining from certain things. The forms of religion were set forth as the substance of it.</article>

    <shortdescription>The Pharisees seek to trap Jesus by asking Him to heal a man on the Sabbath. Jesus calls their attention to a Sabbath law that permits helping an animal. He reminds them how much more valuable is a person. Then He heals the man.</shortdescription>
    <article>When Christ entered a synagogue, he encountered a man with a withered hand. The Pharisees were watching to see if Jesus would heal the man in order to accuse Him of breaking the law. Jesus asks the group if it is lawful to do good or bring life on the Sabbath. Their sullen silence was an admission of defeat. Previous encounters with Jesus had taught them that nothing could be gained by challenging Him publicly, for He always succeeded in turning their own arguments against them in such a way as to reveal truth and to make it evident to the people that the rabbinical position was untenable. The Bible says Christ was angry and grieved at them. It is often said that the only anger without sin is the anger against sin. God hates sin, but He loves the sinner. Erring mortals all too often make the mistake of hating the sinner and loving the sin. Anger against wrong as wrong, without evil wish or design on others, may certainly be considered a commendable trait of character.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Mark records the personal feelings of Jesus. He was "grieved" because the Jewish leaders made use of their high offices and positions to misrepresent the character and requirements of God. No doubt He was also "grieved" because of the results this would have upon these leaders themselves and upon those who followed their misleading ideas. The Greek implies that Jesus’ initial reaction of anger was momentary, but His concern for these benighted children, estranged from their heavenly Father and misconstruing His love for them, continued.</article>

    <shortdescription>After He heals a man on the Sabbath, the Pharisees plot to kill Jesus. He leaves the area and great crowds follow Him who seek healing. He heals them all but asks them not to tell anyone lest greater resistance takes place by the Jewish leaders.</shortdescription>
    <article>The Gospel of Mark notes repeatedly that Jesus moved from place to place to escape undue popularity or undue opposition (see chs. 1:45 7:24 etc.). His withdrawal here was evidently prompted by the desire to avoid further conflict with the religious, and perhaps also the political, authorities. Mark, accordingly, interrupts the series of incidents of conflict in order to comment on the growing popularity of Jesus, which was accompanied proportionately by the increasing hatred and opposition of the Jewish leaders.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
All three synoptic writers mention the great throngs now following Jesus. This situation made apparent the need for a more effective organization, and of more witnesses to devote their entire time to meeting the demands made upon Jesus by the throngs. Two of the three gospel writers, significantly, call attention to the "great multitude" that followed Jesus and clung to Him, immediately prior to the appointment of the Twelve and the Sermon on the Mount (see Matt. 5:1 Luke 6:17).</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus appoints twelve disciples to not only follow Him, but to be sent out to preach, heal, and cast out demons. The Bible lists their names: Peter, James, John, Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James, Thaddaeus, Simon, and Judas.</shortdescription>
    <article>Leaving His followers to spend the night at the foot of the mountain, Jesus Himself spent the entire night in prayer at some secluded spot in the hills above them (Luke 6:12). It was now probably the late summer of A.D. 29 (see Matt. 5:1). Often Jesus devoted an entire night to prayer. Usually such instances mentioned by the various gospel writers preceded points of decision or crisis in the Saviour’s life or ministry.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The night now spent in prayer preceded the ordination of the Twelve, the Sermon on the Mount, and the beginning of the Second Galilean Tour. Jesus specifically called 12 men to Himself. Apparently there was a somewhat larger group of followers, from which the Twelve were selected. None of the Twelve was chosen because of perfection, either in character or in ability. Christ selected men who were willing and able to learn, whose characters might be transformed. All had serious defects when called, but these, by His grace, were removed (except in the case of Judas), and in their place Jesus planted the precious seeds of the divine character that germinated, grew to maturity, and later produced the fruit of a Christlike character (Gal. 5:22, 23). Christ takes men where they are, and, if they are willing and submissive, He transforms them into what He would have them be. He appoints men and women to positions of responsibility, not because He considers them fully prepared for the demands these positions make of them, but because, in reading their hearts, He discerns latent abilities that, under divine guidance, may be encouraged and developed to His glory and to the advancement of His kingdom.</article>

    <shortdescription>Just as Moses gave the law that God gave to him from a mountain, so Christ also gives the law with even more depth and explanation to the people.</shortdescription>
    <article>The appointment of the Twelve constituted the first step in the organization of the Christian church. Christ was King in this new kingdom of divine grace, the Twelve were its charter citizens, or subjects (see Mark 3:14). On the very day the Twelve became charter subjects of the kingdom the King gave His inaugural address, in which He set forth the conditions of citizenship, proclaimed the law of the kingdom, and delineated its objectives. The Sermon on the Mount is thus at once Christ’s inaugural address as King of the kingdom of grace and also the constitution of the kingdom. Soon after the formal establishment of the kingdom and the proclamation of its constitution came the second tour through Galilee, during which Jesus gave a vivid and complete demonstration of the ways in which the kingdom, its principles, and its power can be of benefit to men.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The mountain on which Christ delivered the Sermon on the Mount has been called the “Sinai of the New Testament,” inasmuch as it holds the same relationship to the Christian church as Mt. Sinai did to the Jewish nation. It was on Sinai that God proclaimed the divine law. It was on the unknown mountain of Galilee that Jesus reaffirmed the divine law, explaining its true meaning in greater detail and applying its precepts to the problems of daily life.</article>

    <shortdescription>A Roman centurion in Capernaum approaches Jesus requesting healing of his servant. Jesus says He will come, but the centurion says he is not worthy of Christ coming to his home but He can heal by speaking a word. Jesus marvels at this man's faith.</shortdescription>
    <article>After giving the sermon on the mount, Christ entered Capernaum. It seems that the deputation of elders bearing the centurion’s request met Jesus as He returned to the city. This man's servant was sick. This "servant" was held in high esteem by the centurion, doubtless for the valuable service he had rendered. The term itself may or may not imply personal affection, but in this particular case the centurion was "tenderly attached" to the slave. The servant was about to die. The centurion’s knowledge of Jesus was limited to the reports that had reached him of the Saviour’s great deeds. He had never seen Jesus previous to the present occasion.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The elders of the city approach Jesus on behalf of this centurion. These may have been either the leading citizens of the town or the board of elders of the local synagogue (see p. 56), or they may have served in both capacities. In the centurion’s own eyes he was unworthy (vs. 6, 7). In the eyes of the "elders" he was "worthy" (v. 4). A consciousness of one’s own unworthiness is a recommendation of the highest order. But with the centurion it seems that this appraisal of his status before Jesus was more than humility. Though a believer in the true God, the centurion was not yet a full proselyte, and accordingly in Jewish eyes still a heathen and therefore not eligible to participate in religious services (see on vs. 2, 5). Truly humble of heart before God, and probably conscious as well of his status in the eyes of the Jews, he sought to avoid embarrassing Jesus by obligating Him to enter a Gentile home. This would at best be repulsive to a pious Jew and would doubtless render him ceremonially unclean (see John 18:28).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Though the centurion protested his own unworthiness, Jesus later said of him, "I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel" (v. 9). The remarkable faith of this supposed heathen made him more worthy in the sight of Heaven than any of Jesus’ fellow countrymen. The centurion’s faith that a word from Jesus would be sufficient to heal his servant was extraordinary in itself. The fact that the centurion had never seen or conversed with Jesus made that faith all the more remarkable, particularly in view of the slowness of the Jews and even of Christ’s own disciples to exercise faith (Matt. 6:30 8:26 16:8 see Mark 4:40 Luke 8:25 12:28 17:6). But the fact that the centurion was—officially, from the Jewish standpoint—a Gentile, made his faith seem great, almost beyond belief. </article>

It was not the works of this man that made him worthy, but his great faith in Christ. He believed that Jesus' power could heal the servant because of Christ's authority.</VideoDescription>

    <shortdescription>As Jesus is leaving Capernaum two blind men approach Him seeking to be healed. Christ asks them if they believe that He is able to heal them. They answer, "Yes, Lord." Jesus heals them and tells them to tell no one, but they spread the news.</shortdescription>
    <article>Two blind men cry out to Jesus, the Son of David, for healing. Their use of this term indicates that the blind men recognized Jesus as the Messiah. Jesus asked them if they truly believed He could heal them. Without the exercise of faith on their part Christ would not be able to exercise His power in their behalf. Man’s faith must rise to meet and to unite with the power of God in order that blessings, whether physical or spiritual, may be imparted and received (see Heb. 11:6). Christ heals them and tells them to tell no one about the healing, but they spread the news anyway.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>A man who cannot speak &amp; who is demon possessed is brought to Jesus. Christ casts out the demon and the man's ability to speak is restored. All the people are amazed, but the Pharisees criticize Jesus as casting out demons by the devil's power.</shortdescription>
    <article>A mute demoniac is brought to Jesus. When a man lacks the ability or the faith to come to Jesus for the healing of either body or soul, he is fortunate to have someone interested enough in him to bring him (cf. Mark 2:2, 3). Christ healed the man and he spoke. This was tangible evidence of healing. This is the last recorded miracle for several months, the next being that of feeding the 5,000 the following spring. Whether Jesus went into retirement for the winter after the second tour of Galilee is not stated. Popular excitement occasioned by the many miracles of Jesus tended to obscure the Saviour’s main objective in performing them—the advancement of the kingdom of heaven in the hearts and lives of men. Probably becoming desperate to silence Christ or to turn the people against Him, the Pharisees sought to have it believed that His miracle-working power constituted evidence that Christ was in league with Satan. The fact that Matthew here records no answer on the part of Jesus suggests the possibility that the Pharisees did not advance this claim in His presence, but rather circulated it among the people.</article>

    <shortdescription>As Jesus and His disciples enter the village of Nain they are met by a funeral procession. A widowed mother has lost her only son. Jesus has compassion on her and raises her son to life. People marvel that a great prophet has "risen up" among them.</shortdescription>
    <article>Having formally inaugurated the kingdom of divine grace with the appointment of the Twelve (see Matt. 5:1), and having proclaimed the fundamental law and purpose of the kingdom in the Sermon on the Mount, Christ now set forth on His second tour through Galilee to demonstrate by precept and example the nature of His kingdom and the scope of its benefits to mankind.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
A funeral train is leaving the town of Nain. A widow's only son has passed away. The fact that the woman was a widow, and this her only son, made the situation pathetic in the extreme. Evidently the widow’s extremity touched the hearts of the villagers, and many if not most of them accompanied her to the burial site. Their sympathy was met by the sympathy of the great Life-giver. The Lord had compassion on this woman. The love and pity of Jesus are often mentioned as motives for the performance of miracles. No request came from her lips and, so far as we know, no petition arose from her heart. But in His sympathy for suffering humanity Jesus answered the unuttered prayer, as He does so often for us today.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jesus told her not to cry, then He touched the bier (coffin). In Bible times such a "bier" was probably made of wickerwork. The touch of Jesus on the coffin was a signal to the pallbearers to halt. According to the law of Moses, contact with the dead in any way, such as even touching the bier, brought ceremonial defilement for seven days (see on Num. 19:11). But to Jesus, who knew neither sin nor defilement, and who was the Source of life, there could be no defilement from contact with death. Christ then says, "I say to you, arise!" Then Jesus restored life to the young man and gave him back to his mother.</article>

    <shortdescription>After he heals a man who is blind  &amp; cannot speak, the Pharisees accuse Christ of using the power of Satan to heal. He tells them, "He who is not with me is against me." Jesus then speaks of blasphemy against the Spirit as the unpardonable sin.</shortdescription>
    <article>After healing a blind man who could not speak the people exclaim, as it were. "This cannot be the Son of David [the Messiah], can it?" They may have realized that the Messiah of prophecy was to do the wonderful deeds that Christ performed, but they found it difficult to see in Jesus, apparently a common man among men, the Messiah of prophecy. The fact that many people heard Christ gladly (see Mark 12:37), recognized Him as a great teacher (see John 3:2), and even a prophet (see Matt. 21:11), does not man they necessarily accepted Him as the Messiah. His many mighty works ignited the flame of hope in their hearts that He might be the Messiah, but their preconceived idea of what the Messiah was to be like almost immediately quenched the feeble flame.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Apparently the flickering hope of the people that Jesus might prove to be the Messiah of prophecy (see v. 23) angered the Pharisees. Mark speaks of these Pharisees as "the scribes which came down from Jerusalem" (Mark 3:22), probably spies sent out by the Sanhedrin to observe and report on Christ (see Mark 2:6). These wary foes of Jesus could not deny that a genuine miracle had been performed, for the healed man "spake and saw" (Matt. 12:22). The greater the evidence of the divinity of Jesus, the greater became their anger and hatred, which led eventually to the commission of the unpardonable sin by some of Jesus’ enemies.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In the healing of the blind and dumb demoniac it was evident that more than human power was present. The spies refused to concede that Jesus was divine and possessed power to effect the miracle He must, therefore, be in league with the devil. Christ knew their thoughts and spoke to them and uncovered their claim that Jesus was working with the Satan. The devil could hardly be foolish enough to work at cross-purposes with himself, sustaining the claims of his archenemy, Christ, by cooperating with Him in the expulsion of demons he himself had inflicted upon men. On the basis of such a policy "his kingdom" was certain to fall. Herewith Jesus reduced the argument of the Pharisees to absurdity, and His reasoning was so clear and simple that all could see it. Jesus then deals with the unpardonable sin.</article>

    <shortdescription>While Jesus is speaking to a multitude of people, His mother and brothers want to speak to Him. He points to His followers and says, "Anyone who does the will of My Father in heaven is My brother and sister and mother."</shortdescription>
    <article>Jesus' mother and brothers want to speak to Him. Though undoubtedly concerned about Jesus, Mary had faith in Him, a faith not shared by His brothers (see John 7:5). It was their idea, not hers, to restrain Christ from further activity on behalf of the people. They hoped He would yield to Mary’s persuasive appeal they hardly believed He would listen to their own appeal. Regarding Christ's brothers, the gospel writers make it evident that these were sons of Joseph by a former marriage. The fact that Jesus committed His mother to the care of John (see John 19:26, 27) implies that Jesus’ "brethren" (and sisters) were not actually Mary’s own children. That these brothers were older than Jesus is shown by their attitude and relationship to Him. They tried to restrain Him (see Mark 3:21), they spoke taunting words to Him (see John 7:3, 4), and otherwise interfered with His conduct (cf. Mark 3:31), as only brothers who were older would dare do in those days. To one familiar with life in Bible lands, this argument in itself appears conclusive.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Though these "brethren" did not at this time believe in Jesus (John 7:3–5), they later accepted Him and were numbered among His followers (see on Acts 1:14). At this time Jesus’ brothers were dismayed by reports they had heard concerning His work, particularly how Jesus scarcely had time to eat and sleep. They felt that He was not prudent in His activities and sought to persuade Him to conform to their ideas of how He should conduct Himself. No doubt they were also concerned because of the increasingly strained relations between Him and the Jewish leaders.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When Jesus responded to the inquire, "Who is my mother?", we must remember Jesus was personally devoted to His mother (see John 19:26, 27). His view of the duty of children to their parents is also clearly set forth in His teachings (see Mark 7:9–13). Accordingly, His meaning here is that even those closest and dearest to Him had no right to interfere with His work or to direct how it should be carried out (cf. Matt. 16:23). Christ was focused first on doing the will of His Father. Regarding His reference to "My brothers," Jesus here makes a personal application by the use of nouns in the singular. All who acknowledge God as their Father are members of "the whole family in heaven and earth" (Eph. 3:15). The ties that bind Christians to their heavenly Father and to one another are stronger and truer even than blood ties, and more enduring. Here is a clear denial that Christians should give special attention to Mary (see Luke 11:28).&lt;BR /&gt;

She was to be the surrogate mother and protector of her Creator, while at the same time Jesus was her Savior. Mary was privileged in her role, but she experienced a sword piercing her heart. There is a spiritual lesson in all of this.</VideoDescription>

    <shortdescription>Christ and His disciples get into a boat to cross a lake. A storm arises and threatens to sink the boat. Jesus is asleep and is awakened. He rebukes the winds. His disciples marvel that He has authority over all forces of evil.</shortdescription>
    <article>According to the account in Mark, Christ was already in the little fishing boat, and simply remained there without going ashore to dismiss the people (ch. 4:1, 36). However, since Matthew has separated from its context the story of the storm on the lake (see on ch. 8:18), apparently he deems it necessary, in this connection also, to record Jesus’ entering into the boat (see ch. 13:2). It was probably almost dusk when the disciples shoved the boat away from the shore. This vessel was doubtless the "small ship" placed at Jesus’ disposal (see on Mark 3:9). There were several other fishing boats that left shore at the same time to cross the lake with Jesus (see Mark 4:36).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
A tempest arose. The Greek word is seismos, "a shaking," "a commotion," "a tempest," or "an earthquake." Our English word seismograph is derived in part from this root. Here seismos denotes the turbulence of the sea, and the terrific force of the furious gusts of wind as they struck the boat. The Lake of Galilee is noted for sudden storms of great intensity. In this instance the winds came sweeping wildly down upon the waters of the lake fom the mountain gorges along the eastern shore. However, the evening had been calm, and the disciples had probably not anticipated stormy weather.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The boat began filling up with such rapidity that the disciples lost hope of bailing the water out before it became completely swamped. Several of the disciples were expert fishermen who had spent much of their lives on the Lake of Galilee, and who knew how to handle a boat in a storm. But all their experience and skill failed them on this occasion. The Bible says Jesus was a sleep in the boat. This is the only recorded instance of Jesus’ sleeping. Overcome with utter weariness and hunger at the close of a strenuous day He no doubt fell asleep quickly (see on Matt. 8:18 Mark 4:38).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The disciples called to Jesus twice in the darkness, only to have their voices drowned out by the noise of the storm. Then a sudden flash of lightning disclosed to them the fact that Jesus was still asleep whereupon "they came to him, and awoke him" (Luke 8:24). Astonished that He could sleep through the fury of the gale, and amazed at His apparent unconcern in the midst of their frantic efforts to save the ship and their very lives, they addressed Him somewhat reprovingly, "Carest thou not that we perish?" (Mark 4:38). Though the disciples had seen many wonderful evidences of divine power, it seems that prior to this time Jesus had displayed no control over the forces of nature, and it might not have occurred to them that He could do so. But Christ stood and calmed the storm. It subsided as suddenly as it had risen. No doubt the silence of nature was as startling and impressive as the unexpected fury of wind and wave had been.&lt;BR /&gt;
As Christ stilled the winds and the waves of Galilee, so He is able to still the storms of life that so often burst unexpectedly and with violence over the human soul. Too often the reason we do not experience His power in our lives is that we are "fearful" and have but "little faith."&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>After crossing the lake with His disciples, Jesus is met by two demoniacs in the country of the Gadarenes. Christ stands before them and casts the demon out into a herd of swine. The men are restored to their right minds and told to stay &amp; witness.</shortdescription>
    <article>The preceding day Jesus had delivered the Sermon by the Sea, which consisted largely of parables (see Matt. 13), somewhere along the shore of Galilee bordering on the Plain of Gennesaret (see on Matt. 13:1). The distance across the lake at this point was about 7 mi. (11 km.). It was upon this crossing that Jesus had stilled the storm (see on Matt. 8:18). His purpose in crossing to the less densely populated eastern shore at this time was to enjoy a brief respite from the throngs of people who were now pressing upon Him to the extent that He often had little or no time even to eat and sleep (see Mark 3:20).&lt;BR /&gt;
When the boat landed in this region, two wild men were seen coming toward them. By the time the demoniacs came to the place where Jesus stood, the disciples had fled in terror, and the Saviour was alone with the two demon-possessed men. Somehow they seemed to perceive dimly that here was a Friend, not a foe and they prostrated themselves on the ground at Jesus’ feet. His very presence often seemed to impress deeply even His worst enemies (see Matt. 21:12, 13 John 2:15).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The demons challenged Jesus’ authority (see ch. 1:27 see on ch. 2:10) and basically said, "What right have you to interfere with me?" It would seem that the evil spirits were speaking directly through one of the demoniacs of Gadara to Christ, for Jesus addresses the "unclean spirit" rather than the man himself (see Mark 5:8). Accordingly, the recognition of Jesus as the "Son of the most high God" represents knowledge the spirits possessed, not the demoniacs. Christ cast the demons into a nearby herd of swine and asked the restored men to stay in this region and share their testimony with the unbelieving people.</article>

    <shortdescription>After accepting Jesus' invitation to follow Christ, Matthew holds a feast for his friends, fellow tax collectors. The Pharisees criticize Jesus to His disciples. Jesus tells them He came, not for those who are well, but for those who are sick.</shortdescription>
    <article>When Matthew holds a feast in honor of Jesus, the Pharisees spoke to the disciples that "this man eats with sinners." By complaining to the disciples, the scribes hoped to alienate their respect for their Master. Luke says that the scribes "murmured" against the disciples (Luke 5:30), apparently realizing that a direct attack on Jesus would avail them nothing, even as previous attempts to silence Him had proved fruitless. To eat and drink with Gentiles was an infraction of the ritual law and involved ceremonial uncleanness (Acts 11:3). For practical purposes, tax collectors were classed with the Gentiles and thus were considered among the social outcasts.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Christ responded to the Pharisees. In stating the profound truth of the purpose of His mission to earth Christ revealed the hypocrisy and fallacy of the Pharisees and their attitude toward Christ’s association with tax collectors. If these men were such sinners as the Pharisees claimed, they must be in greater need than other men. Were they not then the very ones for whom Christ should put forth His best efforts? He had come to "save" men (Matt. 1:21), but if He were able only to save those who were already righteous, He could not be truly a Saviour. The test of His mission as the Saviour of men turned on the point of what He could do for sinners.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Pharisees claimed to be able to attain righteousness through strict compliance with the requirements of the ritual law. Later, Jesus made it clear that such "righteousness" was counterfeit and without value in the kingdom He had come to proclaim. But on this occasion, for the sake of argument, He granted their implied claim to personal righteousness (Mark 2:16, 17), for by so doing He was able to make clear the reason why He ought to minister to the spiritual needs of the publicans. In actual fact, the Pharisees were at times guilty of the very sins they so bitterly detested in the tax collectors. Jesus declared that they would "devour widows’ houses" (Matt. 23:14) and release an avaricious son from caring for aged parents (see Mark 7:11), if thereby they themselves might be enriched. Thus the Pharisees, laying emphasis on legal correctness, too often were hypocrites. On the other hand, the publicans, who made no pretense at ritualistic respectability, were sometimes in a better position to accept the teaching of Jesus, in spite of their sins.</article>

    <shortdescription>John's disciples approach Christ and ask why they and the Pharisees fast often, but Jesus and His disciples do not fast. Jesus illustrates that while He is with them, they do not fast, but a day is coming when they will fast.</shortdescription>
    <article>Why do not Jesus' disciples fast? Doubtless John’s disciples shared at least to some extent in his abstemious way of life (see Matt. 3:4), as is evidenced here by their fasting. It seems clear that they were, indeed, fasting at the very time they brought their question to Jesus. There are times when the Christian needs keenness of thought and discriminating judgment he may have important decisions to make, or may need to discern more clearly the will of God. Under such circumstances fasting can prove a great blessing. Such fasting may not necessarily mean complete abstinence from food, but a diet limited to the simple essentials for maintaining health and vigor. The Christian may, like Daniel, refrain from the use of "pleasant bread" (Dan 10:3). God is not honored and one’s Christian experience is not promoted by any practice that weakens the body or impairs the health.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
What Jesus now set forth, in three brief figures, was the incompatibility of His teachings with those of the scribes. John’s disciples, although presumably accepting Christ as the Messiah (see John 1:35–37), nevertheless adhered at least to some of the ritual regulations imposed by the scribes and Pharisees (Mark 2:18). In the parable of the wedding guests, "the children of the bridechamber," Christ defended His own disciples against the charge that they did not conform likewise to tradition. He implied that ritual practices were to be subordinated to concerns of higher importance. Then by the examples of the new wine (v. 22) and the new cloth (v. 21), Jesus developed still further the fundamental principle involved—the irreconcilable difference between the new teachings and the old. Here He explained why He considered rabbinical ritual observances as of no value. Taken together, these three parables were designed to make clear to the disciples of John the Baptist that if they truly believed the teachings of their master, they would accept His also.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus is asked to raise a man's daughter back to life. On the way a woman sick for 12 years reaches out and touches the hem of Christ's garment and is healed. Jesus affirms her faith. Christ then goes and raises the ruler's daughter back to life.</shortdescription>
    <article>The healing of the invalid woman and the raising of the daughter of Jairus occurred soon after the healing of the two demoniacs (see Matt. 8:18 12:22 13:1). The crossing of the lake here referred to was from the vicinity of Gergesa, on the eastern shore (see Mark 5:1), to Capernaum, a distance of 5 or 6 mi. in a northwesterly direction. Apparently a crowd began to gather on the shore as soon as the people recognized Jesus approaching in one of the boats. For a time He remained near where He had landed, teaching and healing, as His custom was when the people gathered about Him. Then, together with some of His disciples, Jesus went to the home of Levi Matthew to attend the feast there given in His honor. It was here that Jairus found Jesus. Jairus came to Jesus and fell at His feet as before a prince or someone of high authority. If he might thereby save his only daughter, this proud rabbi was willing to humble himself even before Jesus, despised and hated by most men of his class. He explain his little daughter was at the point of death. He plead for Christ to lay hands on her. As Jesus made his way, people pressed all around Him.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In this crowd was a woman had planned for some time to reach Jesus, but His absence on the Second Galilean Tour seems to have made this, for the time being, impossible. When she learned that Jesus had returned to Capernaum she hastened to the shore of the lake, where He was teaching and healing. But she searched for Him in vain. Learning, eventually, that He was at the home of Matthew, she made her way there in the hope of reaching Him, but again arrived too late. Now, with the slow progress Jesus was making in the direction of the home of Jairus, she finally overtook Him.&lt;BR /&gt;
But her malady had lowered the vital supply of blood in her body, and she was probably very weak physically in addition to being discouraged form the many vain attempts to secure healing at the hands of the physicians. Also, the nature of the disease itself, together with the ritual uncleanness involved, was embarrassing. It may be she felt hesitant to present her request orally to Jesus, particularly in the presence of so many strangers, lest He inquire as to the nature of her affliction, which He seems to have done sometimes. As Christ passed her by, she reached out and touched His garment and was healed. After affirming her faith, Christ went and healed Jairus' daughter.</article>

    <shortdescription>From prison, John the Baptist hears about Christ's works. He sends two disciples to question Christ. John's faith wavers, but Jesus encourages him to look at the signs of His ministry. Christ affirms John's role and work.</shortdescription>
    <article>A question regarding the Messiahship of Jesus originated with John’s disciples, not with John himself and John was disturbed that these men should cherish unbelief with respect to John’s own testimony that Jesus was indeed the Promised One. If the Baptist’s own disciples doubted his message, how could others be expected to believe? There were some things John did not understand—such as the true nature of the Messianic kingdom, and why Jesus did nothing to effect his release from prison. But despite the doubts that troubled him, he did not surrender his faith that Jesus was indeed the Christ. Disappointment and anxiety troubled the soul of the lonely prisoner, but he refrained from discussing these perplexities of his own mind with his disciples.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In the hope that a personal interview with Jesus would confirm their faith, that they would bring back a faith-strengthening message for his other disciples, and that he might receive a personal message to clarify his own thinking, John sent the two men to Jesus. God permits hours of perplexity to come even to the most worthy and trusted of His servants, in order to strengthen their faith and trust in Him. At times, when it is necessary for their own character development or for the good of God’s cause on earth, He permits them to go through experiences that seem to suggest that He has forgotten them. In view of this, it can be easily understood that the experience of John in prison for a period of about one year was, in the merciful providence of God, permitted by way of encouragement to countless thousands of others who, in later years, must suffer martyrdom. Knowing that John’s faith would not fail (see 1 Cor. 10:13), God strengthened the prophet to endure. Steadfast to the end, John, even in prison and in death, stands forth as "a burning and a shining light" (John 5:35), his fortitude and patience illuminating the dark pathway of life for martyrs of Jesus down through the centuries.</article>

    <shortdescription>After speaking to John the Baptist's disciples about His work, Christ turns to the multitudes &amp; speaks of John's valuable work and role, even speaking of him as the Elijah to come. Jesus then speaks woes on the impenitent cities and offers true rest.</shortdescription>
    <article>Apparently these words of commendation were not for the ears of John, nor for his disciples, because what Christ was about to say would have lessened the force of the personal message He had given to John’s two disciples to carry back to their master (see on Luke 7:23). The eulogy of John, recorded in vs. 7–19, has sometimes been referred to as his funeral oration. John was beheaded about six months after this, not long before the Passover of a.d. 30 (see on Luke 3:19, 20).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Many, possibly all, of the men in this audience had listened to John preach. Christ asks them to analyze their own reaction to that "burning and … shining light" (John 5:35), that they may the better appreciate John’s message in relation to the message Jesus Himself now bore. Christ asks if they went out to see a reed. Reeds grew in abundance in the Jordan valley, where much of John’s brief ministry was spent, and the figure used here would vividly recall to the minds of those who now listened to Jesus the scene of the Baptist’s preaching. The Saviour’s question might be stated, "Did you go out that far just to see the reeds blowing in the wind?" Certainly John could not be likened to the reeds, for he was not of a wavering and vacillating character.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The motive of the throngs who went out to John was not one of seeing the latest styles and finest textured clothing, nor yet the hope that he might provide such clothing for those who became his followers. The hope of material gain did not influence men to respond to the magnetic power of the desert prophet. People saw more than a prophet. John was the personal forerunner of the Messiah (see on ch. 3:3). He was the one to whom was given the most important task of all time, that of introducing the Messiah to the world. In John were combined all the great qualities of a true prophet.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus comes to His hometown of Nazareth a second time. The people are astonished at Christ's teaching, but also offended. They cannot see beyond Him being one of them. Jesus does not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</shortdescription>
    <article>After leaving Nazareth to take up His ministry Jesus did not revisit it until He began His Galilean ministry. The time elapsed was about 18 months (see Luke 4:16), probably from the autumn of a.d. 27 to the spring of a.d. 29 (see Matt. 4:12). The Galilean ministry as a whole continued from the spring of a.d. 29 to the spring of a.d. 30. Thus it was toward the close of this period that the second and final visit to Nazareth took place. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As upon the previous visit (Luke 4:16) Jesus came on the Sabbath day to the synagogue. Evidently it seemed incredible to the people of Nazareth that One who had lived among them could be the Son of God. They wondered how this man could be divine. Literally, "this [fellow]," an expression often denoting contempt.What wisdom is this?  Neither the Jewish leaders nor the townspeople of Nazareth appear to have thought of denying the infinitely superior intelligence, understanding, and wisdom of Jesus. It was altogether too obvious in fact, it was this that troubled them.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The people of Nazareth could not deny the great miracles Jesus wrought any more than they could deny His wisdom. Whether He taught or worked miracles, they were constrained to admit that "he hath done all things well" (ch. 7:37). But this was the carpenter's son. Although in idiomatic Hebrew and Aramaic usage the expression "the carpenter’s son" may be no more than a circumlocution for "the carpenter," there seems no reason to doubt that Joseph had been a carpenter by trade, and that prior to the time He took up His lifework, Jesus followed that trade. This, indeed, is one of the few New Testamentside lights on Christ’s life between His childhood visit to the Temple and His baptism (see Luke 2:51, 52). They also wondered about this son of Mary. The fact that Jesus is here referred to as the "son of Mary" rather than as the "son of Joseph" strongly implies that Joseph was dead.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jesus says a prophet is not without honor in his own country. Christ’s statement seems to have been a commonly known proverb. If Jesus’ own brothers did not believe Him to be the Messiah (see John 7:5), how could His former neighbors be expected to believe?His own country. The people of Nazareth knew Him well (see on Luke 2:52). All of His daily contacts with them testified to His perfection of character, and this they had resented because it placed them in an unfavorable light. In His exemplary character they had seen nothing that particularly appealed to them, nothing that they appreciated or considered of value to them in achieving the objectives for which they lived.His own kin. Even a year later His brothers had not come to believe in Him (see on John 7:5), though they were converted after His death and resurrection (see on Acts 1:14).5. No mighty work. Jesus was hindered, not by any lack of power on His part, but by the people’s lack of faith (see Matt. 13:58).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Herod the tetrarch has an adulterous relationship with Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. When John the Baptist speaks against this sin, Herod throws John in prison.</shortdescription>
    <article>Luke makes reference to the imprisonment and death of John the Baptist at this point in order to complete his account concerning John before proceeding to narrate the ministry of Christ. It seems that John was not imprisoned until a number of months, perhaps a year or more, after the baptism of Jesus, at approximately the time of the Passover of a.d. 29. He remained in prison until the early spring of a.d. 30, and was beheaded a few weeks before the Passover of that year.&lt;BR /&gt;
It appeared to Herod that the people were ready to do whatever John told them to do, and Herod feared that a popular uprising might be the result (Antiquities xviii. 5. 2 DA 360). Josephus does not mention the matter of Herodias in connection with John’s imprisonment, though he elsewhere mentions Herodias’ marriage to Antipas (Antiquities xviii. 5. 4). Thus Josephus probably records Herod’s publicly alleged reason for imprisoning John. It would be unlikely that Herod would announce as his reason for so doing the private matter of Herodias, of which the Jews as a whole disapproved.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
According to Josephus (Antiquities xviii. 5. 2) the prison in which John was placed was the fortress of Machaerus, in Peraea, east of the Dead Sea. The site of Machaerus was discovered in 1807, and ruins of the dungeons can still be seen. However, in view of the sequence of events in Mark 6:17–30 certain scholars think that the birthday celebration may have been held in Tiberias, and therefore question the accuracy of Josephus’ statement.</article>

    <shortdescription>A man asks to bury his father before following Jesus. Christ says, "Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus probably sensed this man was putting off following Christ and was not making a full surrender. Jesus obviously cares about those who mourn.</shortdescription>
    <article>A scribe approaches Jesus and indicates a desire to follow Him. This scribe was a volunteer, one who, in these words, applied for acceptance as a full-time disciple. Similarly, when Jesus said, "Follow me," He extended an invitation to full-time discipleship (see on Matt. 4:19 Mark 2:14). Possibly the scribe had been a part-time follower, and had seen and heard enough to create in his heart a longing to be with the Master constantly and to learn of Him. It seems, however, that he was probably a temperamental individual, given to acting on impulse more than from principle, and that he had not fully counted the cost of discipleship (see Luke 14:25–33).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jesus warns this man of the cost of following Him. In order to accomplish the mission for which He had come to earth, the days of Christ’s ministry were spent, for the most part, in moving about from place to place, not aimlessly (see on Luke 2:49), but with no fixed place of abode. One accustomed to the comforts of home, as this scribe probably was, would very likely find an itinerant life difficult and disagreeable. Gospel witnesses must ever be willing to endure hardship as good soldiers of Jesus Christ (see 2 Tim. 2:3). Perhaps this man had been a casual, part-time disciple, and now proposed that he be accepted as a permanent, full-time disciple. In contrast with the would-be disciple of vs. 19, 20, who tended to be temperamental and to act hastily from impulse, this man—judging from Christ’s response to him—apparently was of precisely the opposite disposition, slow, lethargic, and inclined to procrastinate.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The scribe desires to first bury his father. In all probability the father was currently enjoying good health, and the time of his death was indefinitely in the future. If the man’s father was not dead, but very much alive, Christ’s words must be taken figuratively, not literally. Probably this would-be follower’s request was either an excuse for not following Christ at all or an attempt to postpone the time when it would be necessary to forsake all in order to follow Him (cf. Luke 5:11, 28). If the father were already dead, it is extremely unlikely that Christ would have ordered the neglect of what, in Oriental lands even today, is considered one of the most sacred duties devolving upon a son. Furthermore, in a warm climate the burial of the dead is performed without delay, and if, indeed, this man’s father had died, it is most improbable that he himself would have been listening to Jesus. Obviously, both the man and Jesus anticipate the father’s death at some future time.&lt;BR /&gt;
This man was overcautious as the first man was overenthusiastic. He said to Christ, as it were, "I would like to follow you, but I cannot do so while my father lives." In reply, Christ said to him, so to speak, "I fully recognize your obligation to your parents nevertheless, your obligation to the kingdom of heaven takes precedence even over that." The claims of the gospel transcend those of family ties—not that the latter are relaxed in the least, but rather that they are not to be made an excuse for failing to heed Christ’s call to service (see on Mark 7:11, 12 Luke 14:26).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>John the Baptist speaks out against the adulterous relationship of Herod the tetrarch and his brother's wife, Herodias. She devises a plan to get Herod to destroy John, who is beheaded.</shortdescription>
    <article>The extensive labors of the Twelve during the course of the Third Galilean Tour were evidently sufficient to call widespread attention to Jesus and His work, and to stir the fear of Herod that Jesus was John risen from the dead. Whereas on the two previous evangelistic expeditions there had been but one group going from village to village, now there were seven. Evidently the reports coming to Herod, from all quarters, revealed a rapid extension of the gospel. Whereas in the past Jesus may have appeared to the authorities to be no more than a solitary itinerant preacher accompanied by a motley group of followers, it was now evident that He represented a far larger movement. Herod could no longer help hearing of him. He wondered if Jesus was John the Baptist risen from the dead. It seems to have been superstition combined with a guilty conscience that led Herod to this conclusion.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
John had spoken against Herod's sin of taking Philip's wife, Herodias, and marrying her. For his part, Herod had divorced the daughter of Aretas, king of Arabia. Thus Herod and Herodias each had a living spouse. As a result of Herod’s divorcing his former wife, her father, Aretas, made war on Herod and defeated him. This defeat was looked upon by the Jews as a divine judgment upon Herod because of his indefensible alliance with Herodias (Josephus Antiquities xviii. 5. 1, 2).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Undoubtedly Herod had personally listened to the preaching of John, and for a time it seemed that he would yield to the call to repentance. The law of Moses strictly prohibited a marriage such as that between Herod and Herodias (Lev. 18:16 20:21), and, according to Josephus, the Jews thoroughly disapproved of the union (Antiquities xviii. 5. 4). Herodias hated John and bided her time to kill him. Knowing of the influence that John had exercised over the mind of Herod Antipas (see on v. 20), Herodias probably feared that the tetrarch might divorce her as John had advised. Her wicked devisings finally came to fruition when Herod held a banquet at which Herodias' daughter, Salome, danced. He rashly promised her anything she wanted. When she asked her mother, she said to ask for the head of John the Baptist. Thus ended the life of the greatest of the prophets.</article>

    <shortdescription>The only miracle recorded in all four gospels is the feeding of the five thousand, evidently a very important miracle. The Lord feeds the crowd from five loaves and two fish.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jesus had sent the Twelve out by two’s, that they might have an opportunity to apply the principles they had observed previously in His own ministry. Now they made a thorough report of what had taken place during the course of their itinerary. The Twelve in particular were in need of relaxation and instruction. And even Jesus felt in need of respite from the throngs that pursued Him wherever He went and pressed upon Him from early dawn till late at night. The retirement of the disciples with Jesus to the vicinity of Bethsaida Julias and the miraculous feeding of the 5,000 are the only incidents in the life of Jesus between the baptism and the Triumphal Entry that are reported by all four gospel writers.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The feeding of the 5,000 was the crowning miracle of the Galilean ministry, one witnessed by a vast throng, and one that cannot be explained away by skeptics either of Christ’s day or of ours. As a result of this miracle the Galilean ministry came abruptly to a climax (see Luke 2:49). Compare the healing of the man at the Pool of Bethesda a year previously (see on John 5), which brought the early Judean ministry to a close.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The miraculously multiplied bread—evidence of the genuineness of the miracle—was distributed to each person in the vast throng, not in minute quantity, but sufficient completely to satisfy the appetite. This abundance testified to the limitless power of Jesus. Only when the needs of all were fully satisfied was the supply halted. Jesus was as attentive to the physical needs of those who came to Him as He was to their spiritual needs. But the provision thus made to satisfy physical needs was intended to direct men to their infinitely more important spiritual needs and to the bread of life as the means of satisfying those needs (see John 6:26–51).</article>

    <shortdescription>After feeding five thousand people Jesus sends the disciples away in a boat, dismisses the crowd, and goes to pray on a mountain. The disciples are caught in a storm in the middle of the lake. Christ comes on the water. Peter walks on water.</shortdescription>
    <article>After feeding the multitude, the people wanted to force Christ as a new ruler. Convinced that Jesus was the promised Messiah, or Deliverer of Israel, the multitude were bent on crowning Him king on the spot. Perceiving the sentiment of the multitude, the disciples took the initiative and were on the point of proclaiming Him king of Israel. Judas was the first one of the Twelve to sense the significance of the popular sentiment, and it was he who initiated the project to make Christ king. So rash a course of action would have prematurely brought Christ’s earthly mission to a close. Prompt and decisive action on the part of Jesus was necessary in order to quell the popular sentiment of the people and to control His own disciples. Jesus sends His disciples in a boat to the other side of the lake while He dismissed the crowds and went to pray.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
While crossing the lake, a storm came over them. The disciples had rowed between 25 and 30 furlongs (John 6:19), or about 3 mi., when Jesus overtook them. Ordinarily they could have covered this distance in an hour or so, but as it was they had taken approximately eight hours (see Matt. 14:25). This is evidence of the strong head wind they encountered while crossing the lake. Had the disciples set out to cross the lake when Jesus directed them to go, they might have avoided the storm. But their perversity of heart led them to delay their departure until it was almost dark. Now, some eight hours later (see on v. 25), they were struggling for their lives. As the disciples, in obedience to Christ, set out to cross the lake, feelings of humiliation, disappointment, resentment, and impatience rankled in their hearts. Hesitation on the beach may be said to have given birth to unbelief. The wind was contrary, and so were their hearts but in the providence of God the stormy sea became the means of quieting the tempest in their souls. It is often thus when we find ourselves adrift on a dark and stormy sea of troubles.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When Christ appeared to them, walking on the water, the disciples cried out in fear, but almost immediately recognized that the supposed "phantom" was Jesus, and again cried out, this time for help. It was not until they appealed for help that Jesus spoke to them (see Mark 6:48, 49). Only Matthew records the embarrassing and almost fatal experience of Peter upon this occasion. Peter had been in charge of the fishing business in which at least four of the disciples were engaged before they became disciples (see on Mark 3:16), and it was therefore probably natural to him and to the others that he should be spokesman for the entire group. His natural mood of leadership, now as upon so many other occasions, led to overconfidence and to an impulsive and injudicious course of action. Christ responded to Peter's imperfect faith and he temporarily walked on water until he took his eyes off Christ.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>After Jesus miraculously feeds a multitude of five thousand people, the crowd seeks after Him. Christ encourages them to seek, not for physical food but spiritual food. He teaches them about the bread of heaven. Many turn away from Him at this time.</shortdescription>
    <article>Probably in the synagogue at Capernaum that the people from across the sea found Jesus. Christ ignored their question and began immediately to discuss their motives in seeking Him. His laying bare of their materialistic motives applied not only to the satisfaction of their physical appetites but also to the whole range of their ambitious expectations that He would assert Himself as a military conqueror and political ruler. The labor that Jesus rebukes here is not that which is necessary in order to gain a livelihood. His rebuke is directed rather toward those who carry such labor to the extent of neglecting the nourishment of the soul. What Jesus here reproves is the common habit of laboring only for the things of time, and ignoring the things of eternity. When Christ reveals their selfish motives, many turn away from Him.</article>

    <shortdescription>The Pharisees criticize Jesus and His disciples for not ceremonially washing hands before eating bread. Christ teaches, not against hand washing or unclean foods, but against a ceremonial work to gain salvation. They are offended at His comments.</shortdescription>
    <article>The Pharisees and scribes asked Jesus, "Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread." The Pharisees knew, of course, that the disciples were simply following the custom adopted by Jesus (cf. on Luke 11:38). Indirectly, this was a personal challenge to Jesus. The scribes and Pharisees intended to attribute to Him disregard of their laws. By proceeding indirectly they would probably also avoid offending those who thought well of Jesus. The leaders in Jerusalem looked upon the illiterate and simple people of Galilee with contempt, and commonly referred to them as "people of the soil". It was in the company of such a crowd of these simplehearted Galileans that the present encounter took place.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Evidently writing for non-Jews who might not otherwise understand the nature of the challenge the spies now posed, Mark defines what he means by "defiled." Matthew, probably writing primarily for Jews makes no such explanatory statement. The washing here referred to was strictly ritualistic, not sanitary. This rite is said to have consisted of pouring a small quantity of water upon the fingers and palm of first one hand and then the other with the hand titled so that the water ran from the palm to the wrist, but no farther (all the time care being taken lest the water run back into the palm), and then alternately rubbing one hand with the palm of the other hand. The minimum amount of water prescribed was that which could be contained in one and a half egg shells. It seems, however, that where water was not available a dry ablution was permitted in which a person would simply go through the motions of washing his hands in the prescribed manner.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Christ sought to restore all God’s revealed instructions to their rightful place in the thinking and living of His people. He sought to accord the words of God priority over the words of men. He sought to do away with mere outward forms of religion and to cultivate the true spirit of religion in the heart. With a pretense of obeying the will of God the "elders" (v. 3) were in reality "teaching for doctrines the commandments of men" (v. 7). It was a question of salvation by faith or by works. Jesus affirmed that those who worship God must do so "in spirit and in truth" (see John 4:23, 24). His emphasis on this truth brought Christ into bitter conflict with the Jewish leaders. The danger of exalting human precepts and even human interpretations of divine requirements above the "weightier matters of the law" (Matt. 23:23) is no less today than it was then.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>After an encounter with the Pharisees, Jesus departs to the region of Tyre and Sidon where He comes in contact with a Gentile community. Christ steps over many cultural barriers to minister to these people.</shortdescription>
    <article>&lt;BR /&gt;
The following incident probably occurred in the late spring of a.d. 30, possibly about the month of May. With the feeding of the 5,000 and the Sermon on the Bread of Life in the synagogue at Capernaum (see John 6:1, 25), the Galilean ministry reached its climax. The tide of popularity began to turn against Jesus as it had the year before in Judea and the majority of those who had considered themselves His followers rejected Him (see John 6:60–66). This had been but a few days before the Passover of that year, which Jesus did not attend (see on Mark 7:1).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Third Galilean Tour had greatly alarmed the Jewish leaders. After the Passover a delegation from Jerusalem confronted Jesus with the charge that He was breaking down the religious requirements (see Mark 7:1–23). But He silenced them by revealing their hypocrisy, and they went away in great anger and rage. Their attitude and threats made clear that His life was in danger. So in harmony with the counsel He had previously given the disciples He retired from Galilee for a time (see on Matt. 10:14, 23), as He had from Judea the year before when rejected by the leaders there (see on ch. 4:12). This retirement northward marks the opening of a new period in Christ’s ministry, and the close of His ministry in Galilee, to which He had devoted approximately one year, from about the Passover of a.d. 29 to that of a.d. 30. It was now less than one year before His death.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Although the immediate circumstance that prompted Jesus’ withdrawal to the region of Phoenicia was the encounter with the scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem, the journey had positive objectives also. Jesus had a definite purpose not only in leaving Galilee but also in going to the general region of Phoenicia. Now that He had been rejected by the Jews both in Judea and in Galilee, Jesus sought an opportunity to instruct His disciples in laboring for non-Jews. The heathen needed the gospel, and He now began a series of lessons designed to lead the disciples to realize the needs of the heathen and the fact that they too were prospective candidates for the kingdom of heaven. The withdrawal to Phoenicia provided an excellent opportunity for such instruction. Jesus performed but one miracle during the course of this visit to Phoenicia. This visit, however, was clearly not a missionary journey in the sense that the three tours of Galilee were, for upon arrival Jesus went into seclusion, and planned to keep His presence there a secret (see Mark 7:24).</article>

    <shortdescription>After leaving Tyre and Sidon, Jesus travels through Decapolis to the Sea of Galilee where he heals a deaf and mute man. The people are astonished at Christ's work.</shortdescription>
    <article>A deaf and mute man is brought to Jesus. Apparently the afflicted man did not come of his own volition, having never heard of Christ. Evidently it was the faith of the man’s friends that led him to Jesus. Decapolis was the region in which Christ had healed the demoniacs of Gadara, who had carried out, with faithfulness and zeal, their commission to tell their heathen neighbors of Jesus (see on ch. 5:19, 20). Quite possibly as the result of the work of the formerly demon-possessed men the friends of this deaf-mute decided to bring him to Christ.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The deaf man had an impediment. He not absolutely dumb, for when healed he "spake plain" (v. 35), implying that prior to being healed he could speak, though not plainly. His inability to speak clearly and distinctly may have been a result of his deafness. Christ took him aside to heal him. As He did later with the blind man at Bethsaida Julias (see ch. 8:22–26). Both districts were largely inhabited by heathen (see on Matt. 4:25), and thus it seems probable that this man was likewise a Gentile. Perhaps Jesus took the deaf-mute aside because the unusual procedure He followed in healing him might be misunderstood by the unthinking crowd and interpreted as a form of magic similar to the incantations of heathen miracle workers.</article>

    <article>While teaching a multitude, Christ has compassion on the people since they have not eaten for a few days. The crowd was mostly Gentiles. They were hungry, and Jesus was concerned about their physical well-being, as He had been about their spiritual welfare. He asked His disciples what food they had available. Their response shows their lack of faith. Christ has the people seated and gives thanks for the little they have and everyone eats.</article>

    <shortdescription>The Pharisees and Sadducees who are usually at odds with each other join to ask Christ for a sign to prove His divinity. Christ gives them no sign, except "the sign of Jonah." Later Jesus teaches the disciples to be wary of their teaching.</shortdescription>
    <article>Now, for the first time, the Sadducees united with the Pharisees in an attempt to silence Jesus. A few weeks previous to this Jesus had departed from Galilee to avoid these carping critics. Now, almost the moment He again sets foot on Galilean soil, they renew their attack upon Him. Having earlier confronted Jesus with this very question (asking for a sign), they no doubt surmised what His answer was likely to be. He would refuse, and this refusal they probably intended to present to the people as evidence that His claims to Messiahship were false. They were putting Jesus to the test, even as Satan had done in the wilderness, not with a sincere desire to see something that would convince them, but rather with the hope that He would fail to do so, and thus give them an opportunity to denounce Him and deny His claims. Obviously, Jesus had power to work such miracles, but He consistently declined to do so. He could, but refused, because it would be inconsistent with principle to do so. Christ refused to argue further with these hypocrites. It was useless to do so, for nothing was to be gained, either by way of convincing them or of enlightening the bystanders. Further discussion could serve only to confuse the people and to confirm the Pharisees and the Sadducees in their course of deliberate disbelief and deception.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus heals a man who is blind in two stages. He first uses spit for the man's eyes but he only partially sees. Then Jesus puts His hands on the man's eyes and he can fully see.</shortdescription>
    <article>People brought a blind man to Jesus. Christ led him out of town. There were probably at least two reasons for this: (1) to avoid publicity (see on v. 26), and (2) in order to help the blind man understand and concentrate upon what Christ was about to do for him (cf. on chs. 5:37, 40 7:33). Jesus seems to have performed comparatively few miracles during the period of His public ministry, and in most instances He was among a population that was largely heathen. Christ first spit on the man's eyes. He could not see completely, so Jesus then put His hands on the man's eyes and he was completely healed. This is the only recorded instance in which Jesus performed a cure in two stages. There is no apparent reason for the use of this method in this case. However, it should be noted that, as partial vision was restored to the man, his faith increased and he was ready to believe that Jesus could cure him completely (see v. 23).</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus withdraws to Caesarea Philippi, a city located north of the Sea of Galilee. Christ asks His disciples, "Who do you say that I am?" Peter answers, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." Jesus later rebukes Peter for hindering His work.</shortdescription>
    <article>Christ’s retirement to this Gentile region was partly to escape from the spies, who gave Him no respite so long as He remained in Galilee, and also to have opportunity to instruct His disciples and prepare them for the hour of crisis that would soon bring His brief ministry to a close. The following discussion evidently took place during the course of the travels of Jesus and His disciples, at the close of one of His seasons of prayer.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jesus opened the discussion of His coming passion by directing the thoughts of His disciples to Himself as the Messiah, a subject He seems never to have approached directly before. It was essential that they recognize Him as the Messiah before they could in any way appreciate the meaning of His vicarious sacrifice on Calvary. If He were recognized only as a "teacher come from God" or as one of the ancient prophets risen from the dead, His death could have no more significance than that of any other great and good man. It would be exemplary rather than vicarious. It would have no atoning power. He who would find salvation in the cross of Calvary must first recognize that the One who hung upon the cross was none other than the Son of God, the Saviour of the world, the Messiah, the Christ. It is only on the basis of the Messiahship of Jesus of Nazareth that the cross can be understood and appreciated in its true perspective.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Peter answered on behalf of all the disciples, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." Though many had already rejected the idea that Christ could possibly be the Messiah of prophecy, the disciples were still loyal to Him as such, even though they understood but imperfectly all that was involved in it. Later, of course, they did understand. Except as they grasped this fundamental truth by faith and held firmly to it, they too would fail utterly to grasp the truth that the Messiah must suffer. As it was, when His hour of extremity came, "all the disciples forsook him, and fled" (Matt. 26:56). Even so, Jesus was basing the future hopes of the church on this little band of witnesses, and unless they believed Him to be the Christ, what hope was there that other men would ever believe this sublime truth?</article>

    <shortdescription>Christ cautiously travels through Galilee while warning His disciples that He will be betrayed and killed, but will rise on the third day. The disciples cannot understand what Jesus is saying.</shortdescription>
    <article>If Jesus were to remain long in one locality, the word would soon spread around and throngs of people would gather, and their coming would interrupt the important instruction He sought to impart to His disciples. Hence it seems that Jesus went from place to place in Galilee, probably avoiding the cities and villages that, a few months before this, had witnessed His mighty works. By-passing the cities and towns would be one effective way to prevent people from learning of His whereabouts. Even the disciples failed to profit fully by the words of instruction He had to give, and if the inner circle of believers was lacking in spiritual perception, the common people would not profit by what Christ had to say at this time.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This is the second of at least three specific occasions on which Jesus told the disciples plainly of His coming sufferings and death. There were no doubt other times when Jesus gave them similar instruction, as implied by Matt. 16:21. The desire to be alone with His disciples in order that He might impart this information to them apparently accounts for the secrecy with which Jesus now went about Galilee.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In spite of all that Jesus had told them, in plain language, the disciples still misunderstood. The principal reason the disciples failed to understand was that they did not want to believe it necessary for the Messiah to suffer and die. Such an idea posed a bold challenge to their preconceived opinions about the Messiah. They expected that eventually Christ would reign as a temporal prince and were unwilling to surrender their glowing expectations of the honor they anticipated sharing with Him when that time should arrive.</article>

    <shortdescription>When Jesus discovers His disciples arguing about who will be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven, he calls a child to Him and says they must become like a child. Jesus also stops their sectarian actions and warns of offending the weak in society.</shortdescription>
    <article>The entire discourse of Matthew 18 was given at one time. As in the case of the Sermon on the Mount (see on ch. 5:2), each of the various gospel writers includes portions not mentioned by the others. Except for minor variations (see Mark 9:38–41, 49, 50), Mark’s account is somewhat similar to that of Matthew. Where both Matthew and Mark report the discourse, the account of Mark tends to be slightly more complete and full than that of Matthew. But Matthew has a lengthy section (see ch. 18:10–35) that neither Mark nor Luke has. Luke has a very brief account of the discourse, though elsewhere he reports a number of parallel teachings of Jesus that were given at other times. Matthew’s account is therefore the most complete. The entire discourse may well be entitled "How to Deal With Differences of Opinion and Disputes That Arise in the Church." The great problem that made the discourse necessary was a serious clash of personalities among the Twelve, one that it was necessary to solve if the unity of the group was to be preserved.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
On their return to Capernaum the disciples had sought to conceal their spirit of rivalry from Jesus. He read their thoughts, but said nothing to them at the time. Now, a little after their return, an opportunity arose for taking the matter up with them. At first sight Matthew and Mark seem to differ as to how the matter came up at this time. Matthew states that the disciples initiated the discussion, whereas Mark reports that Jesus did so. However, the two accounts may be harmonized thus: While Peter was away fishing for the tribute money, Jesus took the matter up with the 11 disciples who remained with Him, probably in Peter’s home, but they were reluctant to discuss it. After Peter’s return one of the Twelve ventured to ask Jesus the very question they had been discussing among themselves in secret.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The defect in Peter’s inquiry (see on vs. 21, 22) was that the kind of forgiveness referred to in it was not from the heart, but rather a legal, mechanical kind of "forgiveness" based on the concept of obtaining righteousness by works. How difficult it was for Peter to grasp the new concept of obedience from the heart, prompted by love for God and his fellow men! This completes Jesus’ answer to Peter’s question (v. 21), an answer that also covers indirectly the question, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?" (v. 1). The "greatest" is simply the one who, "from the heart," reflects on the mercy of his heavenly Father and does "likewise" toward his fellow men. This is the true measure of character in our dealings with our fellow men.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus takes Peter, James, and John up on a high mountain and is transfigured before them with brilliant light and clothing that is bright as the light. Elijah and Moses appear with Christ.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jesus took Peter, James and John to a high mountain. Jesus and His companions had kept on climbing, apparently, until it became too dark to go farther. It would seem that Jesus had already spent a considerable portion of the night in prayer by the time of the Transfiguration, for, as the hours passed slowly by, the dew of night was "heavy" upon Him. He prayed for personal strength to face the great test that lay ahead, and also for His disciples, that their faith in Him as the Son of God might be strengthened, that they might understand the necessity of His death as part of the plan of salvation, and that they might be prepared for the hour of trial. Accordingly, He prayed that they might behold His divine glory, which thus far, except for fleeting moments, had been hidden from their gaze.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This was one of the occasions when divinity flashed forth through Jesus’ humanity, to meet the radiance of heaven. It was while Jesus was praying and the disciples were asleep that the mysterious transformation took place. The description of the experience by the three synoptic writers precludes any suggestion that it was a subjective experience on the part of the disciples, or perhaps only of Peter. It was more than a dream or hallucination due to weariness from the day’s journey and worry about Christ’s prediction of His death it was a real experience. Many years later Peter declared that he and his fellow disciples "were eyewitnesses" of the "majesty," "honour," and "glory" of Jesus, and testified to having heard the voice proclaiming Jesus’ Sonship to the Father. Peter presents this outstanding experience as one of the great confirmations of the Christian faith.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In the transfiguration the disciples see Moses and Elijah. It is important to note that regarding both Elijah (see on 2 Kings 2:11, 12) and Moses (see on Jude 9) the Scriptures record the fact that the one was translated to heaven without seeing death and the other raised from the dead. The fact that Moses and Elijah appeared with Christ at this time is therefore not to be taken to prove that all the righteous dead are in heaven. These two, one raised from the dead and the other translated without seeing death, appeared with Jesus, as a type of the glorious kingdom in which the ransomed of all ages will be with Him in glory.</article>

    <shortdescription>A boy who is demon-possessed is brought to Jesus. The disciples tried to cast a demon out of the boy but were unsuccessful. Jesus rebukes their lack of faith and tells them some healings require prayer and fasting.</shortdescription>
    <article>The Scribes bring a demon-possessed boy to Christ's disciples who are unsuccessful in casting out a demon. The Scribes then argue with (or heckle) the disciples. The attitude of the scribes was obviously hostile. This detail is mentioned only by Mark. These hostile scribes may have been some of the ones who "came from Jerusalem" for the purpose of alienating the respect of the people for Jesus and to report on what He said and did. As so often in the past, they attacked Jesus through His disciples. On this occasion they sought to represent Jesus and His disciples as impostors by making much of the fact that here was a demon over which the disciples were powerless.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It seems that the scribes became silent as Jesus approached. No doubt the tense atmosphere that prevailed, and for that matter, the very presence of the scribes, made it evident that they had been belaboring the nine disciples. Having been silenced and chagrined by Jesus whenever they had endeavored to discredit Him in the past, the scribes withdrew from the contest. This gave the father of the poor, demon-possessed boy opportunity to present his request personally. Jesus rewards his small faith and casts out the demon. He then rebukes His disciples for lacking faith.</article>

    <shortdescription>Peter is asked if Jesus pays the annual temple tax for the upkeep of the temple. He says yes, but goes to ask Jesus. After Christ teaches Peter He is free from paying taxes, Jesus has Peter take a coin from a fish's mouth to pay the tax.</shortdescription>
    <article>Does Jesus need to pay the annual temple tax? Jewish leaders approached Peter with this question. Whether a record was kept of those who paid the tax is not known, and whether those who now came to Peter already knew that Jesus had not paid the tax is not known. Furthermore, this was not the time of year when the tax was usually collected. It would seem that had it been known that Jesus had not paid the tax, the scribes, who during the intervening months had repeatedly heckled Jesus in public (see on Matt. 16:1 Mark 7:1–23), would have challenged Him for nonpayment of the tax long before this. Apparently the idea of challenging Jesus on this count had but recently come to their minds it was part of a well-laid plot. In the Greek the word for "your" is in the plural. The tax collectors thus made the matter one of concern to all the disciples, not to Peter only.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Peter’s ready answer (yes) is considered by some to imply that Jesus had customarily paid the tax and that Peter knew of this fact. Actually, Peter may not have known whether Jesus had actually paid it. When asked whether Jesus paid the tribute, Peter immediately recognized the unusual and untimely (see on v. 24) nature of the inquiry and sensed the implied challenge to Jesus’ loyalty to the Temple, which, of course, failure to pay the tax would seemingly indicate. Peter and his fellow disciples were apparently still fully loyal in spirit to the Jewish leaders and Peter’s first reaction was to avoid at all costs anything that would tend to worsen relations with them. But, as upon later occasions (see ch. 22:15–22), the scribes and Pharisees here sought to confront Jesus with a dilemma from which He could not escape. Levites, priests, and prophets were exempt. To refuse to pay the tax would imply disloyalty to the Temple, but to pay it would imply that Jesus did not consider Himself a prophet, and thus exempt from it.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The collector of Temple tribute had no legal right to demand the half shekel of Jesus. Jesus paid it for reasons of expediency, not of obligation. He waived His rights in order to avoid controversy, and did that which He could not rightfully be required to do in order to be at peace with His sworn enemies. Evidently, He would not have His loyalty to the Temple challenged, however unjust the charge might be. Christ’s course of action stands as a lesson to every Christian. We should endeavor to live at peace with all men, and to do more than should be required of us if need be, in order to avoid unnecessary conflict with opponents of the truth. Under no circumstances, however, will the Christian compromise principle in his endeavor to please others.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jesus then asked Peter to go catch a fish and in its mouth would be a coin to pay for Himself and Peter. The miracle was well calculated to impress Peter, a fisherman by trade, who knew how unlikely it was that a fish should have money in its mouth, particularly the specific amount of money designated upon any given occasion, and knew, furthermore, how unlikely it was that he should be able to catch that particular fish at the precise moment he had been instructed to catch it. It was not for His own benefit that Jesus performed this miracle, although half of the amount paid was for Him. The miracle was designed to teach Peter a lesson, and to silence the critical tax-gatherers, who had sought to place Christ in the category of an ordinary Israelite, and thereby challenge His right to teach.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Jesus' half-brothers encourage Him to show Himself more fully to the world, but it comes from hearts of doubt. Christ will show Himself, but the time is not right.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jesus' brothers encouraged Him to reveal Himself more fully, but He said, "My time has not yet come." Jesus’ "brethren" were disappointed in Him. They could not understand His ways. They wondered why He did not capitalize on His popularity. They doubtless thought of the personal glory and benefit that would accrue to them should He assert His Messiahship. Now that many of His disciples had rejected Him (ch. 6:66), these brothers probably hoped that by manifesting His power in the capital city, the religious center of the nation, He might regain some of His lost prestige.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
These "brethren" desired Jesus to show Himself openly to the multitudes gathering in Jerusalem for the feast, and display before them His wonderful miracles. There, they hoped, the rulers would test His claims, and if He were the Messiah and His wonderful works genuine, then amid the joys of the feast, in the royal city of His realm, they hoped He would be proclaimed king. Their solicitude may be compared with that of Mary at the marriage feast, who hoped that Jesus would prove to the group gathered there that God had chosen Him (ch. 2:3, 4).</article>

    <shortdescription>The scribes and Pharisees seek to trap Jesus by bringing an adulteress before Him. They try to corner Christ with a question, but Jesus kneels down and writes in the dust. The accusers leave and Jesus tells the woman, "Neither do I condemn you."</shortdescription>
    <article>The Pharisees catch a woman in adultery and drag her before Jesus. Such cases should properly be brought to the courts. The scribes and Pharisees had contrived a plot to ensnare Jesus so that they might secure His condemnation. Their procedure was contemptible. There was no need to make such a public show of the case before the multitudes assembled at the Temple. Their own public humiliation that followed (v. 9) was fully merited. The law of Moses prescribed death for adultery when a married woman was involved, but did not specify the manner of death.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jesus is questioned. He is set over against Moses. The Pharisees were more concerned with entrapping Jesus than with punishing the woman. They felt that no matter what answer Jesus gave they could involve Him in condemnation. They doubtless knew of His willingness to forgive, and perhaps expected that He would recommend leniency. In this case they could charge Him with setting aside the law. If He recommended carrying out the penalty, they could charge Him with usurping the authority of Rome, which at that time reserved jurisdiction in capital cases.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Christ's response was to write in the dust. This is the only record of Jesus writing. Much indeed has been written about Him, but none of His writings have been preserved. The characters He wrote on the pavement dust were soon obliterated by the Temple traffic. According to tradition He wrote down the sins of the accusers. The practice of writing in the sand is referred to in the Mishnah (Shabbath 12. 5, Soncino ed. of the Talmud, p. 503). Jesus gives the persistent inquirers an answer they are not expecting, and for which they are unprepared. None of them can lay claim to sinlessness. Perhaps before Heaven’s tribunal some of them are more guilty than the woman. None of them accepts the challenge. Jesus is not stating a general principle, one that would make absolute sinlessness the necessary condition of fitness for taking part in the punishment of guilt. This would nullify law, for no one fitted to carry out the execution could be found. He speaks here of a case where men set themselves up as judges of others, whom they ought not to condemn unless they themselves be guiltless. Jesus abhorred adultery, but He also abhorred self-righteous judging.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus proclaims Himself as the light of the world. The Pharisees argue that His witness is false. Jesus defends His witness and tells them they do not know Him or His Father. Christ then foretells His death.</shortdescription>
    <article>As Jesus’ statement concerning the living water (ch. 7:37, 38) had reference to the water-libation ceremony of the Feast of Tabernacles, so His statement declaring Himself to be the light of the world was doubtless connected with the ceremony of lights. This ceremony is described in the Mishnah as follows: "At the conclusion of the first Festival day of Tabernacles they descended to the Court of the Women where they had made a great enactment [a special women’s gallery]. There were there golden candlesticks with four golden bowls on the top of each of them and four ladders [according to the Talmud the candlesticks were fifty cubits high] to each, and four youths drawn from the priestly stock in whose hands were held jars of oil containing one hundred and twenty log which they poured into the bowls.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
"From the worn-out drawers and girdles of the priests they made wicks and with them they kindled the lamps and there was not a courtyard in Jerusalem that was not illumined by the light of the place of the water-drawing. Men of piety and good deeds used to dance before them with lighted torches in their hands, and sing songs and praises. And Levites without number with harps, lyres, cymbals and trumpets and other musical instruments were there upon the fifteen steps leading down from the Court of the Israelites to the Court of the Women, corresponding to the Fifteen Songs of Ascents in the Psalms [Ps. 120–134]. It was upon these that the Levites stood with their instruments of music and sang their songs" (Sukkah 5. 2–4, Soncino ed. of the Talmud, pp. 242, 243).</article>

    <shortdescription>After a confrontation with the Pharisees, Jesus speaks with "believing" Jews who later show by their responses that their belief is shallow. Discussion focuses on being children of Abraham. When Christ claims His deity they seek to stone Him.</shortdescription>
    <article>The Jews considered themselves to be the free sons of Abraham and boasted of their liberty. They were unwilling to acknowledge their bondage, whether literal or spiritual. But their boasted freedom was spurious. Jesus had come to offer them genuine freedom (Rom. 8:2 2 Cor. 3:17 Gal. 5:1). He alone is free who is free from sin. Those who desire this freedom must apply to the Lord Jesus Christ, and must comply with the conditions. It is His peculiar office and privilege to enfranchise all who accept Him. Only through spiritual freedom could the nation attain to the political freedom they so ardently desired. The Jews were the physical seed of Abraham, but they were not his spiritual children. A true child bears the moral impress of the father. The Mishnah describes the disciples of Abraham thus: "The disciples of Abraham, our father, [possess] a good eye, an humble spirit and a lowly soul" (Aboth 5. 19, Soncino ed. of the Talmud, p. 72).</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus illustrates His work as a good shepherd. His sheep hear His voice and follow Him. He protects them and is the Door into the fold. He willingly lays down His life for His followers.</shortdescription>
    <article>The Pharisees were the recognized shepherds of Israel and had been unfaithful to their trust. They had cast out one from the fold who had expressed faith in the Messiah (John 9:34). Jesus designated the Pharisees as thieves and robbers who claimed that they were the shepherds of Israel. They decreed who should be admitted to, and who should be expelled from, the fold. They "shut up the kingdom of heaven against men" and prevented those who sought to enter (Matt. 23:13). They compassed land and sea to make one proselyte, but when he was made he was twofold more a child of hell than they (Matt. 23:15). They took away the "key of knowledge" (Luke 11:52), and by their false interpretation of the Scriptures prevented men from recognizing and accepting the light. Thieves and robbers are they who offer men any other means of salvation than that which has been provided through Jesus Christ (Acts 4:12). The world has had, and will continue to have, its false messiahs. They do not enter by the door, Christ Jesus (John 10:9). Their claims, are false, and their carefully laid schemes will end in disaster.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Christ teaches that His sheep know His voice. The Eastern shepherd lives very close to his flock. When the last sheep has been brought from the fold the shepherd places himself at the head of the flock and the sheep follow him, normally without hesitancy. The custom is referred to in the Midrash: "‘Thou didst lead Thy people like a flock’ [Ps. 77:20]. As a flock follows the shepherd so long as the shepherd leads it, so Israel, wherever Moses and Aaron made them journey, followed them" (Rabbah, on Num. 33:1, Soncino ed., p. 865). "What a lesson for pastors who seek to drive the church like cattle and fail. The figure of Messiah as a shepherd was not new to the Jews. In the Psalms of Solomon, written about the middle of the 1st century b.c., the Anointed One is spoken of as follows: "(He will be) shepherding the flock of the Lord faithfully and righteously, and will suffer none among them to stumble in their pasture. He will lead them all aright, And there will be no pride among them that any among them should be oppressed" (17:45, 46).</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus completes His work in Galilee and travels to Samaria and Peraea spoken of as "the region of Judea beyond the Jordan." Great multitudes of people follow Him and He heals them.</shortdescription>
    <article>The section of Luke beginning with ch. 9:51 and continuing to ch. 18:14 is sometimes called the "great insertion," or the "great interpolation," owing to the fact that this part of the book—nearly one third of it—records material that does not appear elsewhere in the Gospels. The other writers are almost entirely silent concerning this phase of Jesus’ ministry (see on ch. 9:18).</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus appoints and sends out 70 others to share the gospel of the kingdom of heaven. He encourages them to travel lightly and move quickly, not staying where they are not wanted. They return with joy and share their experiences. Jesus rejoices.</shortdescription>
    <article>A comparison here is interesting. There were 12 patriarchs there were also 12 disciples (cf. Rev. 7:4–8 21:12, 14). Moses appointed 70 men to assist him in judging Israel (see Num. 11:16–25) Jesus also appointed 70 men to assist Him. According to Jewish tradition, based on the list of the descendants of Noah in Gen. 10, there were 70 nations in the world. The Sanhedrin was made up of 70 members, plus its president. The number 70 thus played an important role in Jewish thought. To what extent this may have influenced Jesus in the appointment of the Seventy, or whether any significance attaches to the fact that they were 70 in number, is something Inspiration has not revealed and on which speculation is idle.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This missionary expedition bears the marks of a carefully organized evangelistic campaign. The fact that the Seventy were sent to certain selected localities means that Jesus had budgeted His time and had determined in advance exactly where He would go during the months that remained (see on ch. 2:49). The fact that the Seventy went first to the towns and villages of Samaria implies that Jesus must have conducted a rather extensive ministry there during the winter of a.d. 30–31. The friendly attitude of Jesus toward the people of Samaria manifested upon the occasion of His visit with the woman of Sychar and His ministry for the people of that vicinity (see John 4:5–42) must have done much to break down prejudice. That visit had occurred about two years prior to this time, probably during the winter of a.d. 28–29. Upon that occasion "many" had already come to believe on Him (John 4:39, 41). The ministry of the Seventy for the Samaritan people would prepare the disciples for their later labors in that region (see Acts 1:8). After the resurrection, marked success attended the labors of the apostles there.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus tells the parable of the Good Samaritan in the context of sending out 70 helpers into Samaria. The story teaches how "doing the law" is more important than simply claiming to keep the law. It is a story that speaks to the issue of prejudice.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jesus was on His last journey from Galilee to Jerusalem. The narrative implies that the event took place in Jericho. The incident involving the Samaritan and the victim of robbery had but recently occurred. The question the lawyer asked Jesus had been carefully framed by the religious leaders. A professional teacher of the law himself, the lawyer confronts Jesus with a problem concerning which the scribes themselves spent much time in discussion. The lawyer’s question reveals the fact that his concept of righteousness was entirely wrong. To him, as to most Jews of the day, gaining salvation was essentially a matter of doing those things that were prescribed by the scribes. Thus he considered that one could earn salvation by works. In the Greek, emphasis is placed on the word "do."&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jesus asks the lawyer his understanding of the law. It was the lawyer’s business to know the answer to his own question. He was a professor of Jewish law, and as such it was entirely appropriate that he should be given the opportunity to answer. Jesus’ question does not necessarily imply a rebuke. It was a courtesy to give him an opportunity to answer his own question. The lawyer quotes from Deut. 6:5. When Jesus affirms his answer, the lawyer seeks to justify himself by asking, "Who is my neighbor?" Christ then tells the story of the Good Samaritan to illustrate that anyone (not just a fellow Israelite) in need is your neighbor.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus' disciples hear Him pray and ask the Lord to teach them how to pray. Christ instructs them by sharing the Lord's Prayer and by teaching them the importance of being persistent in prayer. We must ask for God to answer.</shortdescription>
    <article>The disciples were greatly impressed as they listened to the manner in which Jesus prayed, intimately communing with His heavenly Father as one friend does with another. His praying was different from that of the religious leaders of the day, in fact, from anything else they had heard. Formal prayer, expressed in set phrases and seemingly directed to an impersonal God a great way off, lacks the reality and vitality that should distinguish prayer. The disciples thought that if only they could pray as Jesus prayed, their own effectiveness as disciples would be greatly increased. In view of the fact that Jesus had taught them by precept (Matt. 6:7–15) and example (Luke 9:29) how to pray, it seems likely that upon this occasion the request came from some disciples who had not been with Jesus upon similar occasions in the past. The term "disciples" need not be confined to the Twelve. These disciples may have been of the Seventy. In harmony with the request, "Teach us to pray," Jesus responded by giving a model prayer, a parable to illustrate the spirit of prayer, and some admonition encouraging faithfulness and diligence in prayer (ch. 11:2–13).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Jesus teaches that we are to spread the light of truth all around and not hide it. He also teaches that light enters our minds and hearts through our eyes, so if our spiritual eyes are open we will have truth inside.</shortdescription>
    <article>The fact that Luke has already recorded Christ’s sayings about a lamp and its light in connection with the Sermon by the Sea implies that the subject matter of ch. 11:33–36 was presented at a later time, probably in connection with the Peraean ministry. That Jesus did repeat much of His former teaching during this period is certain. These facts may also imply that vs. 14–32 record Peraean incidents.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus is asked by a man to "tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me." Christ does not administer civil justice but leaves that to the proper authorities. Jesus senses the covetous spirit in people's hearts. He tells a parable of a rich fool</shortdescription>
    <article>A man who addressed Jesus had heard the Lord’s stern denunciations against the scribes and Pharisees and His counsel to the disciples about appearing before magistrates. He reasoned that if Jesus should speak to his brother with the same bold authority, he would not dare to do otherwise than what Jesus told him to do. He conceived of the gospel of the kingdom as nothing more than a means for furthering his own selfish interests. Compare the attitude of Simon Magus toward salvation (Acts 8:9–24).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The kingdom Jesus came to proclaim was "not of this world" (see John 18:36). He never commissioned His disciples as agents of social justice, important as that may be, nor did He at any time attempt to adjudicate between men. Like the prophets of old (Micah 6:8 etc.), Jesus clearly set forth the principles that should govern a man’s relationships with his fellow men but left the administration of civil justice exclusively to the duly appointed civil authorities. In no instance did He deviate from this rule, and those who speak in His name would do well to follow His example in this as in other respects.</article>

    <shortdescription>Christ shares a parable about being both watchful and faithful while the master is delayed. We should be prepared for Christ's coming. We should recognize our commitment may separate us from family. We should know the times in which we live.</shortdescription>
    <article>Watchfulness is the keynote of this brief parable. Here for the first time Jesus teaches publicly concerning His second coming. The close of His earthly ministry is already in sight. He therefore sought to prepare men for His ascension and return in power and glory. The emphasis of the parable is upon right living in view of the Master’s return.</article>

    <shortdescription>The Pharisees try to scare Jesus with a warning that Herod seeks His life. Jesus' time has not come and He still has work to do. Christ then mourns for Jerusalem that often has killed prophets.</shortdescription>
    <article>It was approximately a year prior to this that Herod had taken the life of John the Baptist. In view of the awe in which Herod held Jesus and his desire to see Him it is most unlikely that he actually sought Jesus’ life. Apparently the Pharisees used this device in an attempt to frighten Jesus out of Peraea into Judea, where they could lay hands on Him themselves. For nearly two years the Jewish leaders had been plotting His death and the Jews had recently tried twice to stone Him.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Jesus teaches the responsibility of the spiritual leaders to not only seek after sinners, but to have a genuine concern for them. His first of three stories is about a man willing to leave 99 sheep in order to find one lost sheep.</shortdescription>
    <article>It seems that during His Peraean ministry Jesus paid particular attention to the underprivileged and despised classes of society and much of His teaching during this time was either directed to them or given concerning them. The parables of ch. 15 emphasize God’s care for those whom men often despise, His efforts to win their confidence, and His joy when they respond to His appeals.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It is important to note that the three parables present different aspects of the problem of sin and salvation, and that none is complete in itself. In each parable the lost is found and restored, and thus, in each case, Jesus justifies His attitude toward sinners and His efforts on their behalf. The first two are twin parables, and emphasize the trouble men take to recover lost property and their joy upon meeting with success. The first parable emphasizes the care of the shepherd, and hence the intrinsic value of a soul in the sight of God. The second parable illustrates the latter point in a different way. The third parable illustrates and emphasizes the process by which the lost finds his way back to God. Jesus often answered questionings or criticism by telling parables, as upon this occasion.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Eastern shepherd commonly knew each sheep personally and cared for it not only as one of the flock but for its own sake. Not only so, but the loss of a single sheep would make an appreciable difference in his income. In the parable the fact that the sheep became lost was evidently due to its own ignorance and folly, and once lost it seemed completely helpless to find its way back. It realized that it was lost, but knew not what to do about it. The one lost sheep represents both the individual sinner and the one world that has been lost. This parable teaches that Jesus would have died had there been but one sinner as He did die for the one world that had sinned.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus continues teaching about searching for the lost. In this parable a woman loses one of her precious dowry coins &amp; searches to find it. Unlike the lost sheep which knows it is lost, the coin represents people who are unaware of being lost.</shortdescription>
    <article>As the former parable was apparently addressed to men in the audience, the parable of the lost coin was perhaps directed particularly to the women who listened. Jesus often used illustrations that appealed to women in particular (cf. Matt. 13:33 Luke 17:35). In the case of the lost sheep, the owner was moved both by pity for the sheep and by his own financial interest in the sheep. Here, the element of pity is lacking. The woman had only her own carelessness to blame for the loss of the coin, and her desire to reclaim it was based exclusively on her personal interest in it. The sheep was to blame, in a sense, for straying the coin could not be blamed for losing itself. This parable emphasizes the intrinsic value of a soul, and the fact that a lost sinner is of so much value in the sight of God that He will "seek diligently" in order to reclaim it.</article>

    <shortdescription>The parable of the prodigal son is actually about two sons, one who leaves home and returns and the other who stays home but is resentful. Christ teaches the Heavenly Father's love for both sons.</shortdescription>
    <article>This, perhaps the most famous of all the parables of Jesus, consists of two parts. The first part (vs. 11–24) emphasizes the emotions of the father of the lost son, his love for the boy, and his joy when the prodigal returned. The second part (vs. 25–32) is a rebuke to those who, like the elder son, resented the father’s love and joy. This latter section was probably Christ’s answer to the murmuring of the scribes and Pharisees (see v. 2). Whereas the parables of the Lost Sheep and the Lost Coin stress God’s part in the work of redemption, the parable of the Lost Son emphasizes man’s part in responding to the love of God and acting in harmony with it. The Jews had completely misconstrued the nature of divine love (see on v. 7). In the parable the younger son represents the publicans and the sinners, the older son, the scribes and the Pharisees.</article>

    <shortdescription>In the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, Jesus teaches that we decide in this life our eternal destiny. If we waste our opportunities, we lose everlasting life and do not have a second chance after we die.</shortdescription>
    <article>In Christ’s parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus (Lk 16:19–31) Lazarus is pictured as a helpless, diseased beggar who was brought each day and laid at the gate of a certain rich man in hope of finding enough scraps of food from the wealthy man’s table to sustain a miserable existence. As he lay there the half-wild scavenger dogs licked at his sores, but the rich man completely ignored him. Eventually Lazarus died, and later the rich man died also. The parable then represents their respective conditions as being radically reversed. Lazarus was seen by the former rich man as reclining blissfully in "Abraham’s bosom" while he himself was being tormented in hell. When the rich man appealed to Abraham to send Lazarus to relieve his agonies, Abraham reminded him that he had not aided Lazarus when he had the opportunity. The rich man then requested that Lazarus be sent to warn his still-living brothers, so that they might escape the torments he himself was suffering. Abraham retorted that they had the writings of Moses and the prophets to instruct them, and if they would not heed these, neither would they heed one from the dead.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As clearly set forth in the context this parable was designed to teach that future destiny is determined by the use men make of the opportunities of this present life. Jesus was not discussing either the state of man in death or the time when rewards will be passed out He was simply drawing a clear distinction between this life and the next and showing the relationship of each to the other. Furthermore, to interpret this parable as teaching that men receive their rewards immediately at death clearly contradicts Jesus’ own declaration that "the Son of man shall … reward every man according to his works" when He "shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels". It is one of the most important rules of interpretation that figurative expressions and narratives are to be understood in terms of the literal statements of Scripture concerning the truths referred to. Even those who attempt to force this parable into a pattern of interpretation that teaches contrary to the immediate context and to the general tenor of Christ’s teachings concede that many of the details of the parable are figurative.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus' friend, Lazarus, dies. Mary &amp; Martha, his sisters, are deeply grieved. When Jesus finally comes He assures them He has power over death. Even though he has been dead four days, Christ calls him from the tomb. The Pharisees plot to kill Jesus.</shortdescription>
    <article>Lazarus was a resident of the village of Bethany. He was the brother of Mary and Martha, and a beloved friend of Jesus (Jn 11:1–3). He appears in the Bible as the subject of one of Christ’s greatest miracles. According to the narrative, Lazarus was taken ill, and the fact was reported to Jesus, who then was laboring probably in Perea, some 20 mi. (c. 32 km.) or more from Bethany. Instead of hastening to the sick man, as Lazarus’ sisters doubtless expected, Jesus lingered for two days, during which time Lazarus died (Jn 11:6, 7). This Jesus permitted "for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby" (v 4) for by the event that followed He was able to prove undeniably to His friends and enemies that He was the Lord of life (vs 25, 26). Jesus and His disciples finally arrived at Bethany, but not until Lazarus had been buried 4 days (v 17). Accompanied by Mary and Martha and many onlookers, Jesus went to Lazarus’ tomb. At His command, after some remonstrance on the part of Martha, the stone covering the opening of the tomb was removed (vs 39–41). Then Jesus, after thanking His Father for hearing Him, called in a loud voice for His dead friend to come forth (vs 41–43). Thereupon the shrouded Lazarus awoke and emerged from the tomb (v 44). This great miracle caused many to believe in Jesus as the Messiah, but it confirmed His enemies in their conviction that they must get rid of Him (vs 45–53). Lazarus, too, was marked for death by Jesus’ enemies, for he was a living demonstration of the power of Christ (ch 12:10, 11).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>As Christ travels to Jerusalem, He passes through Samaria and Galilee and heals ten lepers. Only one returns to give thanks to Jesus, a foreigner and a Samaritan who is affirmed for his faith.</shortdescription>
    <article>Ten lepers sought healing from Jesus. These men were not within the village, as this would not be permitted. They accosted Jesus as He was about to enter the village. They may have shared a rude hut out in the open fields at some considerable distance from the village. For comments concerning the nature of the disease, the restrictions on those suffering from it, the attitude of the Jews toward those suffering from it, and the ritual provisions that applied to those healed of the disease, see on Mark 1:40–45, which records the first instance of Jesus’ healing leprosy. They stood afar off as the law required. They were not permitted to come close to other men, even on the highway. These leprosy victims were more careful in abiding by the law of segregation than the one mentioned in Mark 1:40–45.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jesus told them to show themselves to the priests as required by the law of Moses (see on Mark 1:44). As they went they were healed. Healing was conditional upon an act of faith. They were not healed so long as they lingered in Jesus’ presence, but only as they proceeded to carry out His instructions. When they left Jesus they were still leprous. It is evident that had they awaited visible evidence of healing before setting out for Jerusalem, where they were to be pronounced "clean," healing would never have come. It was necessary for them to act in faith, as if they were already healed, before healing actually came. He who does not come to the Lord in faith need not expect to "receive any thing of the Lord" (James 1:7 cf. Heb. 11:6). Without obedience there is no faith, for "faith without works is dead" (see James 2:17–20). He who has genuine faith will act in accordance with every requirement of God, but without faith obedience is impossible and unavailing. Neither can exist alone without the other (see James 2:17).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
One, and only one of them, returned to thank Christ. Realizing that divine power had released him from the bonds of his loathsome disease, "one of them" made first things first—he praised God. This Samaritan stands out in the gospel record as a prime example of gratitude. He fell down on his face. This is the typical Oriental posture of supplication and gratitude, whether to God or to man (see on Esther 3:2). This man was a Samaritan. Possibly the other nine felt that, as sons of Abraham, they deserved to be healed. But this Samaritan, who may have considered that he did not deserve the blessing of health that had come to him suddenly and unexpectedly, appreciated the gift Heaven now bestowed upon him. Those who forget to thank God for blessings received, and truly to appreciate what God does for them, are in grave danger of forgetting Him altogether.</article>

    <shortdescription>The Pharisees inquire "when is the kingdom of heaven coming?" They are implying Christ is a false messiah. Jesus answers them that the kingdom comes to those who are carefully looking and able to see it in their very midst.</shortdescription>
    <article>It was now nearly four years since John the Baptist had begun proclaiming that "the kingdom of heaven is at hand" (see Matt. 3:2 see on v. 1). For at least two years the people of Galilee had heard Jesus proclaiming the same message (see on Matt. 4:12 Mark 1:15). Now, the Pharisees come inquiring how much longer they must wait before they can expect to see tangible evidence of the fact that the kingdom is, indeed, coming. In making this demand the Pharisees quite evidently pose a challenge to Jesus’ Messiahship, and imply that He is a false messiah.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Apparently it was their erroneous concept of the Messianic kingdom that prompted the Pharisees to ask this question (see on ch. 4:19). They conceived of the kingdom of God as a political entity, with Messiah King a temporal ruler who would subdue all nations and subject them to Jewish rule (see Vol. IV, pp. 25-38). Inasmuch as their selfish dreams had not yet materialized, the Pharisees were certain that the "kingdom" had not yet arrived. In their minds it was still future.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The kingdom of which John and Christ had spoken, the kingdom of grace, was already here, but the blind Pharisees had not detected it because they were observing only the outward appearance of things (see 1 Sam. 16:7). They had witnessed no signs that could be construed as heralding the kind of kingdom they had in mind. It would take spiritual discernment to detect the coming of the kingdom of divine grace to the hearts of men (see on Luke 17:21).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jesus said, "The kingdom of heaven is within you." That is, meaning either "in your midst" or "in your hearts." There has been some dispute as to which meaning is favored by the context here. The only other use in the New Testamentof the word here translated "within" clearly has the sense of "inside" rather than "in the midst of" (see Matt. 23:26). The kingdom of divine grace was certainly not in the hearts of the Pharisees, and it is this fact that has led many commentators to favor the reading "in your midst." Yet Jesus was clearly addressing the Pharisees (see on Luke 17:20). It should be noted however that, even so, Jesus’ statement does not require the meaning "in your midst." He could simply be saying to them, "The kingdom of God is not something that you may expect to see by close observation with your natural eyesight. You will discover it, if at all, within your own hearts."</article>

    <shortdescription>The Pharisees test Jesus in order to trap Him by asking a question about divorce. Christ directs them to the Scriptures where God created marriage &amp; teaches that divorce was never the Lord's ideal. Except for adultery, couples should never separate.</shortdescription>
    <article>For nearly two years now spies commissioned by the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem had followed Jesus with the twofold objective of finding some accusation to bring against Him and of attempting to discredit Him in the eyes of the people. Upon two previous occasions since the Feast of Tabernacles attempts had been made in Jerusalem to stone Jesus. It was commonly known that His life was in danger should He again venture into Judea, for the Jewish leaders were seeking His arrest (John 11:57). Again and again since the healing of the man at the Pool of Bethesda the scribes and Pharisees had sought to entrap Jesus with questions calculated to elicit statements that might later be made the basis of charges against Him.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Pharisees asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for just any reason?" Christ pointed them to God's ideal plan in the beginning. The Pharisees countered by asking about Moses' certificate of divorce. Jesus said, "This was permitted because of the hardness of your hearts." According to Christ’s statement the OT law that made provision for divorce was a concession designed to meet circumstances that were far from ideal (see on Deut. 24:4). However, Christ’s teaching here makes it clear that the provisions of Moses’ law with respect to divorce are quite invalid for Christians (see on Matt. 19:9).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
But, Christ adds an exception. It should be noted that in the New Testamentthe term "fornication" covers all illicit relationships both before and after marriage. To the modern English reader the word "unchastity" conveys more exactly the meaning of porneia as it is used in the NT. Under the Mosaic law the penalty for marital unfaithfulness was death (see on Lev. 20:10), not divorce. Furthermore, under Moses’ law the death penalty was mandatory, whereas under the Christian law here set forth by Christ divorce is not mandatory, but permissible. From Jesus’ teachings here it may be inferred that the innocent party is free to choose whether the marriage relationship shall be continued. Reconciliation is ever the ideal, especially if children are involved. Here and in Jesus’ parallel discussion in Matt. 5:32 it seems to be implied, even though not specifically stated, that the innocent party to a divorce is at liberty to marry again. This has been the understanding of the great majority of commentators through the years.</article>

    <shortdescription>People bring their little children to Jesus to be blessed. The disciples try to stop them, but Jesus rebukes them and encourages the children to be brought to Him. He lays His hands on them and blesses them.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jews customarily took their children, particularly at the age of one year, to be blessed by a rabbi. When the disciples discouraged mothers from bringing their children to Christ, He rebuked them. The disciples completely misunderstood Jesus. They considered this request a waste of their Master’s time and an unnecessary interruption in what was, to them, the more important task of preaching the gospel to adults. They thought they were protecting Jesus from annoyance. According to Mark, Jesus was "much displeased" with the peremptory action of the disciples (see ch. 10:14). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jesus encouraged parents to bring their children to Him. Jesus loved children and that they loved Him. He appreciated their unaffected love and devotion. He was interested in them and fond of them. Upon more than one occasion He referred to the characteristics and interests of childhood to illustrate spiritual truth. Jesus "laid hands" on them and blessed them. The touch of Jesus that had so often brought healing to the sick now imparted blessing to the children. It is worthy of note that Jesus did not baptize them, but simply committed them to the love and care of the Father.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>A wealthy young ruler asks Jesus, "What good thing must I do to get eternal life?" After he says to Jesus that he keeps the commandments, Christ challenges him to sell everything he owns, give it to the poor, and follow Him. He goes away sad.</shortdescription>
    <article>The man in this incident is usually called "the rich young ruler," a composite name based on the three synoptic accounts of the incident. According to Matthew he is said to have been "young" (ch. 19:20), and in Luke he is spoken of as a "ruler" who was "very rich" (ch. 18:18, 23). According to his viewpoint he was conscientious and had lived an exemplary life. As a "ruler" he occupied a position of responsibility and was a member of the "honored council of the Jews". Whether this was the local sanhedrin or council of the town in which he lived or the Great Sanhedrin in Jerusalem is not certain.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The rich young ruler seems to have accosted Jesus as He was leaving the town. That the young man came "running" reflects youthful eagerness, and that he "kneeled" indicates sincerity (Mark 10:17). His attitude was markedly in contrast with that of the Pharisees, who had recently come "tempting" Jesus. This incident and the instruction afterward given the disciples (vs. 23–30) teach first, the importance of self-renunciation as a requirement for entrance into the kingdom of heaven and second, the danger of a love for money.&lt;BR /&gt;

        <VideoDescription>The focus of this sermon is the story of the Rich Young Ruler found in three gospels. He was a good person but lacking one thing. Only one thing will keep us from the kingdom. We need to give all to Christ. The Lord wants all your heart.</VideoDescription>

    <shortdescription>While traveling up to Jerusalem for the Passover, Jesus takes His disciples aside and tells them of what is to come. The disciples know the rulers want to destroy Christ, but they do not comprehend what will happen and its meaning.</shortdescription>
    <article>During these last months of His life on earth, Jesus had been in and out of Jerusalem and Judea a number of times, but devoted most of His ministry to Samaria and Peraea. It was now probably late March or early April of the year A.D. 31. Jesus arrived in Bethany on the Friday before the Passover. It was doubtless along the way, prior to the arrival in Jericho, that the incidents of Matt. 20:17–28 took place. Jesus informed the disciples that He would be betrayed and condemned to death. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Jews had been plotting to kill Jesus ever since the healing of the invalid man at the Pool of Bethesda two years previously, and had set spies to follow Him wherever He went. The success of His Galilean mission had led them to intensify these efforts. Repeatedly thereafter they became more bold in their public attacks upon Him. More recently, during the course of the Peraean ministry, they had made repeated attempts to arrest Him and to kill Him. Their plans were now rapidly taking more definite shape, particularly since the resurrection of Lazarus a few weeks prior to this time. For the first time Jesus specifically mentions the fact that the Gentiles, the Roman authorities, will be instrumental in His death. Three years before, Jesus had told Nicodemus that He must be “lifted up,” thus implying crucifixion (see on John 3:14). Now, for the first time, He clearly foretells the manner of His death.</article>

    <shortdescription>Just after Jesus shares how He will give His life as a ransom for the world, James and John come with selfish motives seeking a place of honor in the kingdom of God. Christ points out that true greatness in God's kingdom is to be a servant.</shortdescription>
    <article>To think that James and John came to Jesus with their selfish request to be first in the kingdom, immediately after Jesus had so vividly set forth the circumstances of His approaching death! Here the selfishness that moves the human heart stands forth in stark contrast with the selfless love of God. Perhaps it was meditation upon the announcement that the Twelve would sit upon twelve thrones “when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory” (ch. 19:28), that prompted James and John to request the thrones next to that of Jesus.</article>

    <shortdescription>While eating a meal at the home of Simon the leper, a woman (Mary) anoints Jesus with costly perfume. She is criticized by the disciples, but Christ defends her actions.</shortdescription>
    <article>A Pharisee (Luke 7:36–40) whom Jesus had healed of the dreaded leprosy. He considered himself a disciple, had openly associated himself with Jesus’ followers, but was not altogether convinced of His Messiahship. The feast was held in honor of Jesus. Lazarus was also an honored guest, Martha served, and Mary Magdalene whom Simon had led into sin and whom Jesus had healed of demon possession, was also present.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Mary came with an alabaster box and perfume and annointed Jesus head (and feet). Immediately there was a discussion. According to John 12:4, 5 the protest began with Judas. The other disciples apparently joined him in the criticism, which was probably voiced in whispers that circulated around the table. Judas resented the fact that the perfume had not been sold and the money deposited in the communal treasury, where he could personally have access to it, “because he was a thief” (John 12:6). Jesus rebuked them and affirmed Mary's act.</article>

    <shortdescription>As the Passover draws near, the leaders gather to plot how to capture and destroy Christ. They do not want to do this during the feast because of Jesus' popularity with the people. Then Judas approaches the leaders and offers to betray Jesus.</shortdescription>
    <article>The Jewish leaders wanted to capture Jesus and put Him death. But popular sentiment among the throngs gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover, the event that marked Israel’s first deliverance as a nation, was strongly in favor of proclaiming Jesus as Messiah-King (see on v. 4). It would not be safe, the leaders reasoned, to deal with Jesus until these crowds should have departed from the city. But, their deliberations having reached this point, Judas came with a proposal that apparently changed their plans (vs. 14, 15). It seems that Matthew here inserts the narrative of the feast at Simon’s house (vs. 6–13), which took place in Bethany, while the priests and Pharisees were in council in the palace of Caiaphas in Jerusalem, by way of explaining the change in plans. Following the rebuke received at this feast Judas went directly to the palace, and there arranged to betray Jesus.</article>

    <shortdescription>Passion Week is the closing week of Jesus' life before being crucified. It is marked by the triumphal entry on one Sunday and the resurrection on the following Sunday. It is marked by teaching, the Lord's Supper, the betrayal, trial, and crucifixion.</shortdescription>
    <article>A few weeks after the raising of Lazarus, Jesus once more turned His steps toward Jerusalem. Resting at Bethany over the Sabbath He was entertained in the home of Simon. About that time Judas went to the palace of the high priest with an offer to betray Jesus into their hands. On Sunday Jesus rode triumphantly into Jerusalem, publicly manifesting Himself to be Messiah-King. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The excitement of the people who had come to Jerusalem to attend the Passover was aroused to the highest pitch and they hailed Him as king. Jesus’ disciples doubtless took His acceptance of this homage as proof that their glad hopes were about to be fulfilled, and the multitude believed that the hour of their emancipation from the Romans was at hand. Jesus realized that this course of action would bring Him to the cross, but it was His purpose thus publicly to call the attention of all to the sacrifice He was about to make. On Monday He cleansed the Temple a 2d time thus repeating at the close of His ministry the same act by which He had opened His work 3 years before.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
That night Jesus retired with 4 of His disciples to the Mount of Olives, where He outlined what must yet take place before the establishment of His visible kingdom upon earth. Wednesday of Passion Week Jesus spent in retirement with His disciples. On Thursday night He celebrated the Passover with them, at the same time instituting the ordinance of the Lord’s Supper. After the supper He counseled them at length concerning the future and His eventual return. That night Jesus was arrested, and the following morning He appeared 1st before the Jewish authorities and later before Pilate and before Herod. Jesus was condemned to death by the Jews, and the sentence received the reluctant ratification of the Roman procurator. That same day Jesus was led forth to be crucified.</article>

    <shortdescription>As Jesus comes to Jerusalem, He sends two disciples ahead to secure a donkey and its colt. They are brought to Jesus and He rides the colt into Jerusalem as the rightful King. It angers the leaders who reject Him and later crucify Christ.</shortdescription>
    <article>The triumphal entry of Christ into Jerusalem took place on Sunday before the Passover, which fell on Friday in A.D. 31 Jesus had arrived in Bethany, about 2 mi. from Jerusalem, the preceding Friday, and had rested there over the Sabbath. All four gospel writers record the Triumphal Entry. The account of the Triumphal Entry is given in its simplest form in John, and is related at greatest length by Luke. The details given by the four evangelists vary from writer to writer, indicating separate accounts, yet the accounts are not contradictory but rather complementary.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Preparations for the Triumphal Entry began, apparently, late in the morning, for it was about the time of the evening sacrifice, approximately 3:00 P.M., that Jesus reached the brow of Olivet overlooking Jerusalem and that events reached a climax. It was much later than that when He finally reached the Temple. Whereas in the past Jesus has taken every precaution against any popular demonstration acknowledging Him as the Messiah, He now not only encourages this very thing but takes the initiative in bringing it about. To be sure, the disciples and many of the people no doubt expected Jesus to set up His kingdom at this paschal season. Any surprise the disciples may have experienced arose from the fact that Jesus now apparently reversed His former attitude toward publicity. This changed attitude must have filled the disciples with unwarranted enthusiasm and hope. They failed to understand the true significance of the event until after the resurrection.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jesus was following the custom of a royal entry into the city, as in the days of old. His hour had come, and for the first time He presented Himself to Israel as her rightful King, the One who was to sit upon the throne of David. Jesus later acknowledged the title “King of the Jews” (Luke 23:3 John 18:33, 34, 37), but hastened to add, “My kingdom is not of this world” (John 18:36). But the Jewish leaders refused to accept Him as their King. Jesus was not now appearing in His role as King of the kingdom of glory (see Matt. 25:31), but as King of the spiritual kingdom of divine grace. Jesus knew that this episode in His life mission would inevitably lead to the cross, yet went through with it steadfastly and purposefully. It was necessary that the eyes of all men be turned toward Him in the closing days of His life, that all might understand, if they would, the significance of His mission to earth.</article>

    <shortdescription>After the triumphal entry, the next day Jesus enters Jerusalem and is hungry. He sees a fig tree and thinks to find fruit to eat, but it is barren. Christ curses the fig tree, which represents the fruitless Jewish nation.</shortdescription>
    <article>As Jesus entered Jerusalem from Bethany the day after the triumphal entry, He was hungry. Jesus probably followed a more or less direct route from Bethany into Jerusalem, up the gentle, eastern slope of the Mount of Olives and down the comparatively steep western slope and across the Kidron Valley into Jerusalem (see on Matt. 21:1 Luke 19:41). The fig tree attracted attention by being the only one of the trees in the orchard fully leafed out. Jesus saw the tree some time before reaching it. Apparently this particular tree grew near to the road (see Matt. 21:19). A fully leafed fig tree gave promise of well-developed, though not necessarily ripe, fruit. On the other hand, leafless trees, as the rest of the trees in the orchard were, raised no false hopes that fruit would be found on them, and therefore occasioned no disappointment.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In this acted parable (see on v. 14) the fully leafed fig tree represented the Jewish nation, and the other trees, the Gentile nations. True, the Gentiles bore no fruit, but then, none was expected of them because they made no profession of bearing fruit. This precocious fig tree, however, had leaves that betokened figs.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
But it had nothing but leaves. Here was promise without performance. Of all vices there was none Jesus found more offensive than that of hypocrisy (see on Matt. 6:2 23:13). Like the fruitless fig tree, Jewish religion was destitute of fruit. It was replete with form and ceremony but lacked true godliness. In Palestine the early crop of figs usually matures in June, and the late crop in September. It was now near Passover, probably in April, and thus only a few weeks before the early crop would mature. Although it was unusual to expect to find figs this early in the season, nevertheless, a tree in full leaf might, conceivably, have fruit approaching maturity. It should also be noted that in Oriental lands green or unripe fruit is often relished (see on Isa. 28:4).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The barrenness of the tree represented the unproductiveness of Israel, and the curse, the judgment Jesus was to pronounce the following day—“your house is left unto you desolate” (see on Matt. 23:38). It was also on the day following that Jesus sternly censured the scribes and Pharisees for their hypocritical pretensions (see Matt. 23:13–33).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The purpose of this acted parable was to prepare the minds of the disciples for the scenes of the next few days, during which the Jewish leaders would confirm their rejection of Jesus. Acted parables often lead men to think more effectively than mere words could possibly do.</article>

    <shortdescription>Early during the Passion Week, Jesus enters the temple and for the second time in His ministry He cleanses the house of God. It has become a marketplace instead of a place of worship.</shortdescription>
    <article>Undoubtedly, the throng that accompanied Jesus had intended to crown Him as king of Israel. Although Jesus never lent encouragement to the erroneous ideas the Jews held concerning His kingdom, He now proceeded to act in the role of Messiah-King in order that all men might have full opportunity to understand the significance of the crucifixion (see on vs. 1, 5). He declared the Temple to be “my house” (v. 13), and as its rightful owner He exercised His authority to determine what use should be made of its sacred precincts (see on v. 23).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The outer court, the court of the Gentiles, was the scene of this unholy traffic. In the Temple market were sold the various kinds of animals and birds required for sacrifice, together with cereal, salt, incense, and oil (see Vol. I, pp. 698-705). This market was considered a necessary convenience for the pilgrims who came from great distances, and who thus found it impractical to bring their own sacrifices. The noise, commotion, and sharp bargaining carried on must have offended the religious consciousness of those who worshiped God “in spirit and in truth” (John 4:24). This traffic was licensed by the Temple authorities, who made a handsome profit from it. But those who carried it on revealed that they had a gross misconception of the character of God and of the requirements He made of those who love and serve Him.</article>

    <shortdescription>After He cleanses the temple, the chief priests and elders of the people confront Jesus and ask by what authority He does these things. He in turn asks them a question. If they will answer His question, He will answer their question.</shortdescription>
    <article>When Jesus cleansed the Temple for the second time, it was Monday before the Passover A.D. 31 and the last time Jesus taught in the Temple. He was already teaching the people when accosted by the leaders (see Luke 20:1). Many of “the chief priests” were Sadducees, as most of the scribes were Pharisees. Both Mark (ch. 11:27) and Luke ch. 20:1) include the scribes in their accounts of this incident. The Sanhedrin had already met, earlier in the morning, and had determined to demand of Jesus His credentials. Possibly some of the same men who now confronted Him may have been among the number sent to John the Baptist with a similar question three and a half years before. If so they had heard John declare Jesus to be the Messiah.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The leaders asked Jesus by what authority did He cleanse the Temple. At the First Cleansing of the Temple the Jewish leaders had demanded a “sign” as proof of Jesus’ authority to teach (see John 2:18). Since that time the leaders of Israel had been provided with repeated evidences of Jesus’ power and authority (see on Matt. 16:1). The Jews recognized that prophets might teach the people without rabbinical approval, but expected them to give evidence of their divine commission. Now, by their question, the Jewish leaders sought incriminating evidence against Jesus.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jesus responded by asking them a question. The procedure of answering one question by propounding another was approved in rabbinical debates. The counter-question was supposedly designed to point the way to the answer of the original question. Jesus now adopted this mode of reply. In reality Jesus was not evading the issue, for their answer to His question would, in principle, provide also an answer to their own question. The wisdom and skill with which Jesus met the challenge was an additional evidence of His divinity.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus tells a story to tactfully help the Jewish leaders see themselves in a clearer light. The story is about two sons who were to work in their father's vineyard.</shortdescription>
    <article>The purpose of Jesus in this parable was to set forth the true nature of the choice the Jewish leaders were making with respect to the gospel of the kingdom as proclaimed by John the Baptist and by Jesus. Tactfully but purposefully Jesus led them, as He so often did, to condemn themselves (see v. 41), so that they might view their conduct in its true light.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Jesus tells the second of two parables meant to help the Jewish leaders see themselves more clearly. They end up pronouncing guilt upon themselves. The story is about a landowner who planted a vineyard.</shortdescription>
    <article>In this parable, Christ tells of a householder who plants a vineyard. The grapevine was one of the national symbols of Israel. Near the very spot where Christ now stood, at the entrance to the Temple, was a large, magnificent vine wrought in gold and silver that represented Israel (Josephus Antiquities xv. 11.3 see DA 575 see on John 15:1). The words of Matt. 21:33 are borrowed largely from Isaiah’s allegory of the Lord’s vineyard (see Isa. 5:1–7). This parable places emphasis on the rich blessings God had bestowed upon Israel, that they might provide the world with the fruit of divine character (see on Matt. 21:34). In health, intellect, skill, prosperity, and character the people of Israel were to become the greatest nation of the earth, revealing to all men the glory of God’s purpose.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When the householder leaves, he sends servants to check on his vineyard. His servants are severly mistreated. The message is that Christ has made the Jewish leaders the keepers of the law. As representatives of God they are to treat the prophets of God with care, not mistreat them. Someday the master (God) will bring justice to these wicked tenants.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus tells a story of a marriage feast in which someone attends who does not have on the wedding garment provided by the king. He is discovered and cast out.</shortdescription>
    <article>The parable of the Marriage Feast has much in common with the parable of the Great Supper (Luke 14:16–24). Some critical scholars have concluded that the similarities point to a basic identity of the two parables. Their conclusion denies Christ the privilege of relating the same story on different occasions and varying its details to suit the needs of the truth He designed to teach on each occasion.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Basically a king has a wedding for his son and when few people come, the king commands that people be searched and brought in off the streets. Special wedding garments were provided for all guests by the king himself. A festal hall filled with properly attired guests would be an honor to the king and to the occasion. A person inappropriately clad would bring dishonor upon the host and introduce a discordant note into the festivities. The wedding garment represents “the righteousness of Christ”. Hence, the rejection of the garment represents the rejection of those traits of character that qualify men to become sons and daughters of God. Like the guests in the parable, we have nothing suitable of our own to wear. We are acceptable in the presence of the great God only when clad in the perfect righteousness of Jesus Christ, by virtue of His merits. This is the “white raiment” Christians are counseled to buy (see Rev. 3:18 cf. ch. 19:8). The man without a wedding garment represents professed Christians who feel no need of a transformation of character. This guest was apparently interested only in the privilege of eating of the king’s bounties. He did not truly appreciate the privilege accorded him. The honor of the king and the importance of the occasion meant nothing to him. He forgot that the feast was being held in honor of the king’s son, and thus of the king himself. How well clad he may have been was beside the point, for he had declined the only thing that qualified him to sit at the king’s table and enjoy the festivities and bountiful provisions that accompanied the wedding celebration.</article>

    <shortdescription>The Pharisees seek to trick Jesus into making a statement whereby they might condemn Him. They send their own disciples with some Herodians to ask Christ whether it is lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not. Christ's words leave them speechless.</shortdescription>
    <article>The Pharisees tried to trap Jesus. Sending one of their own disciples, they hoped Christ would not recognize their craftiness and suspect a plot, for He had no doubt met most if not all of them. But these strangers had every appearance of being honest young men sincerely seeking an answer to what was, among the Jews of that time, a most perplexing problem (see on v. 17). Luke speaks of these disciples of the Pharisees as “spies” (see on ch. 20:20). For three years spies sent out by the Sanhedrin had been following Jesus nearly everywhere He went (see on Matt. 19:3 Luke 11:54). These particular disciples were Herodians, a Jewish political party that favored the house of Herod Antipas (see p. 54). The Pharisees were ardent nationalists, who opposed Herod as well as Caesar, whereas the Herodian partisans were collaborationists. Bitter enemies in the realm of politics, they were united against Jesus, as they had been against John the Baptist (see on Mark 6:14). On this occasion the Herodians were to be witnesses to Jesus’ answer, ready to accuse Him if He gave the slightest hint of disloyalty to the government.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
These spies wanted Jesus definitely to commit Himself, one way or the other. Should He approve of paying tribute to Rome, they thought to present this as evidence that He was against the law of God, which the Pharisees claimed forbade the payment of taxes to a foreign power. Thus He would forfeit His popular acclaim as the Messiah. Should Jesus forbid the payment of taxes, He would be represented to the Roman authorities as a traitor and a revolutionary. Either way, the Pharisees expected to gain. But Jesus disappointed them by refusing to go along with either one or the other of the two propositions of the dilemma. It was not a matter of either this or that, He replied, but of both.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Taking a Roman coin Jesus said, "Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and to God what belongs to God." The “tribute money” (see v. 19) then in common circulation bore Caesar’s image, and must therefore have been minted by him and belong to him. The fact that the Jews had the money in their possession and used it as legal tender was in itself evidence that they acknowledged, however grudgingly, Caesar’s authority and jurisdiction. Caesar therefore had a right to claim what was his. Herewith Jesus sets forth the fundamental principle that determines the Christian’s relationship to the state. He is not to ignore the just claims of the state upon him, because there are certain “things which are Caesar’s.”&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Yet, God’s authority is supreme therefore the Christian’s supreme loyalty belongs to God. The Christian cooperates with “the powers that be” because they are “ordained of God” (Rom. 13:1). Therefore, to pay tribute to Caesar cannot be contrary to the law of God, as the Pharisees claimed (see on Matt. 22:17). But there are certain “things” in which Caesar has no right to interfere (see on Acts 5:29). God’s jurisdiction is absolute and universal, Caesar’s subordinate and limited. The Pharisees had anticipated either a Yes or a No answer, and had not considered the possibility of an alternative to the dilemma they proposed. They were forced to realize that they were no match for Jesus, in spite of their careful planning.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>On Tuesday of Passion Week, Christ is approached by the Sadducees who seek to embarrass Jesus with an intellectual question about marriage and the resurrection. Jesus rebukes them for their lack of knowledge about the Bible and God's power.</shortdescription>
    <article>The Sadducess professed belief in the Scriptures, but they were, for all practical purposes, materialistic and skeptical in their philosophy. They believed in God as Creator, but denied that He was in any way particularly concerned with the affairs of mankind. They denied the existence of angels, of the resurrection, of the afterlife, and the operation of the Holy Spirit in men’s lives (see Acts 23:8). The Sadducees posed as intellectually superior to their fellow men, and made light of the strict legalism and traditions emphasized by the Pharisees. In coming to Jesus at this time the Sadducees aimed to embarrass Him with one of their stock questions, which had always been most confusing for the Pharisees, who believed in the resurrection. They anticipated that Jesus would be no more able to give them an answer than were the Pharisees.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Sadducees quoted, in substance, the levirate marriage law (see on Deut. 25:5, 6). According to this law, if a woman was left a childless widow, her late husband’s brother was to marry her. The first son born to this new union was to be considered the son of her first husband, to perpetuate his name, and to inherit his property. After presenting a scenario of seven brothers all dying, they asked, "Whose wife will she be?" This question was not loaded with political dynamite like that on paying tribute to Caesar (see on v. 17). It was merely in the realm of speculative theology. However, failure on the part of Christ to give a satisfactory answer would deal a mighty blow to the high opinion in which He was held by the people (see ch. 21:46).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Sadducees proved that the educated can be as ignorant and as steeped in error as the unlearned. Wise in their own philosophy though the Sadducees were, their information on this subject was incomplete, and there was at least one vital factor they had not considered—“the power of God.” Jesus went on to show that although the doctrine of the resurrection may not be as explicitly taught in theOT as some might wish, it is implicit throughout the OT. Jesus told them they did not know the Scriptures. The Sadducees are said to have prided themselves on being more exact students of the Scriptures than the Pharisees, but Jesus here asserts that in spite of all their vaunted knowledge of the Word of God, they are profoundly ignorant. Evidently there will be no need for marriage, because a different order of life will prevail.</article>

    <shortdescription>A lawyer asks Jesus, "Which is the greatest commandment?" Christ answers him by quoting the Old Testament and then summarizes His point: love to God and love to mankind. The entire law hangs on these two points.</shortdescription>
    <article>A lawyer (who was a Pharisee) asked Jesus, "Which is the great commandment?" Though this question dealt with fundamental principles, it was nevertheless probably prompted by the rabbinical attempt to arrange all the commandments of the law in a hierarchy of importance. Where the requirements of two commands appeared to be in conflict, the one assumed to be “greater” took precedence and released a man from responsibility for violating the “lesser” of the two (see further on ch. 5:19). Here, “great” means, in effect, “greatest.” The Pharisees exalted the first four precepts of the Decalogue as being more important than the last six, and as a result failed when it came to matters of practical religion.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jesus answered by quoting Deut. 6:5, "Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart." There must first be love in the heart before a person can, in the strength and by the grace of Christ, begin to observe the precepts of God’s law (cf. Rom. 8:3, 4). Obedience without love is as impossible as it is worthless. But where love is present a person will automatically set out to order his life in harmony with the will of God as expressed in His commandments. Christ’s purpose here in enumerating different parts of one’s being is simply another way of saying that love for God, if truly present, will permeate every aspect of the being.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Then Jesus stated the second, which is "like it," to love your neighbor as yourself. Jesus here quotes from Lev. 19:18, where “neighbour” refers to a fellow Israelite. Jesus, however, widened the definition of “neighbour” to include all who are in need of help (see Luke 10:29–37). The law of love toward God and man was by no means new. Jesus was the first, however, to unite the thoughts of Deut. 6:4, 5 and Lev. 19:18 as summing up “the whole duty of man,” though Micah comes very close to the same idea (see on Micah 6:8).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Man’s natural tendency is to make self first, irrespective of obligations incumbent upon him in his relations to God and to his fellow men. To be completely selfless in dealing with his fellows, a man must first love God supremely. This is the very foundation of all right conduct. In other words, Jesus affirms that the OT is nothing more nor less than an exposition of the two great principles here enunciated—love for God and love for man. For the reply of the “lawyer” to Jesus’ declaration see on Mark 12:32.</article>

    <shortdescription>A large group has gathered to hear Jesus' responses to His critics. The three attempts to trap Christ have failed. Now Jesus turns to them and asks a question about David's son (quoting Psalm 110). The leaders are silenced from that day on.</shortdescription>
    <article>All three attempts by the Pharisees to make Jesus incriminate Himself had failed. Now Jesus turns the tables on His would-be accusers and asks them a question about the Christ, that is, of the “Anointed One,” or the “Messiah”. Here Jesus uses the term “Christ,” not as a personal name, but as a title. The Jews acknowledged the Messiah (Christ) of prophecy, but denied, of course, that Jesus was that Messiah. Jesus confronts the critics with an apparent paradox they cannot solve, a dilemma to which they had no more of an answer than when Jesus previously propounded a difficult question (see ch. 21:25, 27).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jesus quotes from the book of Psalms (see Luke 20:42 see on Ps. 110:1 cf. Acts 2:34 Heb. 1:13). He asks, "How is he his son?" In other words, if David calls Messiah “Lord,” implying that Messiah is older than David himself, how can Messiah also be David’s “Son,” and thus be younger than David? The only possible answer to Jesus’ question is that the One who was to come as Messiah would have existed prior to His incarnation on this earth. As David’s “Lord,” Messiah was none other than the Son of God as David’s “Son,” Messiah was the Son of man (see on ch. 1:1). Obviously the Jewish leaders were unprepared to answer this question because of their erroneous concepts of the Messiah (see on Luke 4:19). They could not very well answer the question without admitting that Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah, the Son of God. In asking this question, then, Jesus brought the Pharisees and scribes face to face with the central idea of His mission to earth, for this question would undoubtedly, if faced sincerely and intelligently, have led to the recognition of His Messiahship.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
No man was able to answer Jesus. The Jewish leaders discovered that it was useless to question Jesus further, for each dilemma with which they confronted Him, He turned on them, and in so doing proved them ignorant of Scripture and incompetent to be the spiritual leaders of the people. In at least one other instance, Jesus confronted them with a question that embarrassed them (cf. ch. 21:23–27). Each attempt to discredit Jesus proved to be a boomerang.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus tells His disciples to follow the good teachings of the Pharisees, but not their evil example. Jesus then denounces the scribes and Pharisees with eight "Woes" and then prophesies the destruction of Jerusalem.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jesus spoke "woes" upon the Scribes and Pharisees. This was probably Tuesday, late in the day. This was Jesus’ last day of teaching in the Temple, and the discourse was His concluding public address. Quite evidently He sought, by His scathing denunciations against the scribes and Pharisees, to break the chains that bound the people to tradition and to those who perpetuated it. Chapter 23:1–12 was addressed to the disciples and to the people in general, and vs. 13–33 to the scribes and Pharisees in the audience. In the latter section there are seven “woes,” or eight if that of v. 14 be included.</article>

    <shortdescription>During Jesus' last visit to the temple some Greeks come to worship and want to see Jesus. Andrew and Philip tell Jesus who speaks to them about His coming death. A voice comes from heaven at this time. The people listening are not sure of it.</shortdescription>
    <article>Some Greeks came to worship at the Temple and wanted to see Jesus. This incident probably occurred on the Tuesday preceding the crucifixion, in connection with Jesus’ last visit to the Temple. The fact that they came to worship rather than to partake of the Passover suggests that these Greeks were not full proselytes. Josephus mentions foreigners who came to Jerusalem to worship at the Passover season (War vi. 9. 3 [427]). Half proselytes, like the Gentiles, were restricted to the Court of the Gentiles.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When Philip and Andrew told Jesus, the Lord said, "The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified." In speaking of a grain of wheat falling to the ground and dying, Christ pointed to the harvest of souls for the kingdom that would come by His death. The human race would have perished and there would have been no harvest of souls for the kingdom. By His death Jesus brought life to all who would fix their faith in Him.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
He who is bent on saving and preserving his physical life here will lose his “soul,” or eternal life. He who is willing to sacrifice himself in service for God in this world will preserve his “soul” and enjoy life everlasting in the world to come. Thus the law of self-sacrifice is the law of self-preservation, the law of self-serving is the law of self-destruction. He who is ready to cast away everything most dear in this life that stands in the way of his spiritual growth will find at length that he has lost nothing worth while and that he has gained the true riches (see Phil. 3:8–10). The world looks upon the way of self-denial and self-sacrifice as foolishness and waste, even as a small child might regard the casting of good grain into the ground a senseless waste. But the future world will reveal that the devotee of this present world was indeed foolish and that the child of God was truly wise.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus' final public ministry happens here in the Temple. As He leaves He tells others that He has come as a light into the world. He speaks words of judgment on those who reject Him as the Messiah.</shortdescription>
    <article>One last time Jesus calls to the leaders of the Jews, but they rejected Him. The fact that the contemporaries of Jesus had heard from Him the truth concerning His identity and mission left them without excuse. They could not claim ignorance as to the requirements for salvation. If they had not heard the truth, they would not have been held responsible (see on ch. 9:39–41). In rejecting the words of Jesus the Jews were rejecting God the Father, whom they professed to worship. Of this, Jesus sought to warn them. Thus it is also when men refuse the words of the messengers but also the One who gave of Heaven. They reject not merely the messengers but also the One who have them their message and sent them forth (see on Matt. 10:40).</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus leaves the Temple. The disciples try to show Christ the buildings. Jesus tells them this temple will be destroyed. They ask him 2 questions: "When will these things be?" And, "What will be the sign of Your coming?" Jesus teaches about the end.</shortdescription>
    <article>Christ foretold the destruction of the temple and what great calamities will come before it. As the same time He shared the signs of His coming to judgment. Because that day and hour is unknown, we ought to watch like good servants, expecting every moment our master’s coming.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As Jesus went out of the Temple courts on Tuesday afternoon where he had spent the day teaching, he had been assailed repeatedly by group after group of the Jewish leaders. Finally, in His last public discourse (ch. 23), He delineated in unmistakable terms the hypocritical character of these “blind guides” (v. 16), and then departed from the Temple courts forever. The discourse given privately to some of the disciples on the slope of the Mount of Olives occupies all of chs. 24 and 25. Leaving the Temple, Jesus and at least four of His disciples made a steep descent to the Kidron Valley, and ascended the slope of the Mount of Olives, which rises some 400 ft. (c. 122 m.) above the Kidron Valley. Being about 300 ft. (c. 91 m.) higher than the Temple, the mountain provides a view of the Temple and the city.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Temple was the pride and joy of every Jewish heart. Jesus predicted not one stone would be left upon another. This prediction was literally fulfilled at the time Jerusalem fell in A.D. 70. Josephus (War vi. 4. 5–8 [249–270]) vividly describes the destruction of the Temple and efforts made by Titus to save it. The excellent construction of the building gave assurance that it would withstand the elements indefinitely. The city of Jerusalem itself was held to be, for all practical purposes, impregnable, but Jesus predicted that it would be destroyed by force. It was hard for them to grasp the import of Jesus’ declaration concerning the destruction of the Temple, particularly in relation to recent events such as the Triumphal Entry and the Second Cleansing of the Temple, which seemed to them to presage the imminent establishment of the Messianic kingdom. Doubtless they came to Him privately because it would be considered treason to talk about such things publicly.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The disciples apparently understood that Jesus was to go away for a time, after which He would return in power and glory to take His kingdom. Jesus, evidently, must already have given more explicit instructions on this subject than the Gospels record. Popular belief held that when Messiah came He would disappear for a time, and that when He reappeared no one would know whence He came. However, this is the first extended discussion of the second “coming” so far as the Gospel record is concerned, although it had been implied in the parables of the Pounds (Luke 19:12–15) and the Wicked Husbandmen (Matt. 21:33–41 cf. ch. 16:27). In the minds of the disciples “these things”—the destruction of the Temple, and the coming of Jesus a second time at “the end of the world”—were closely united. They conceived of these events as taking place either simultaneously or in rapid succession.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
 Jesus blended in His answer to the disciples’ question events leading up to “the end” of the Jewish nation as God’s chosen people, and “the end” of the world. The lines cannot always be sharply drawn between the two. No small part of what Jesus delineated of the future applied particularly to events soon to take place with respect to the Jewish nation, the city of Jerusalem, and the Temple. However, the discourse was also given for the benefit of those who should live amid the last scenes of earth’s history. The signs enumerated in vs. 4–14 primarily to the fall of Jerusalem and some of them secondarily to our time, and those of vs. 21–30 quite exclusively to events leading up to the Saviour’s second coming.</article>

    <shortdescription>When the last Passover of Christ comes, His disciples ask Him where they would prepare and eat the Passover. He instructs them to go to a certain man and say, "The Teacher says, 'My time is at hand ...'" The disciples go and prepare things.</shortdescription>
    <article>The head of the household had the responsibility of making arrangements for the celebration of the Passover, as he had for all other religious interests of the family. He was, in a sense, the priest of the family. Being, spiritually, “members of the family of Jesus”, the disciples naturally turned to Him for directions concerning their preparation for the Passover. It was apparently Thursday morning, Nisan 13, when they came to Jesus, for they celebrated the Passover together that same night (see Matt. 26:17, 20 14:12, 16–18 Luke 22:7, 8, 13–15). Apparently even the disciples closest to Christ (Luke 22:8) did not as yet know in detail, at least, what plans Jesus had for the Passover supper. It seems evident, therefore, that Judas would not know either.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It would seem that Jesus had spent the night, that is, Wednesday night, outside Jerusalem. From Friday to Tuesday He had spent the nights in Bethany, probably at the home of Lazarus. Tuesday night He lodged on the Mount of Olives. Where He spent Wednesday and Wednesday night we are not told. It was probably Tuesday when Judas went the second time to the Jewish leaders, completed arrangements to betray his Master, and agreed to do it at one of His places of retirement. Jesus knew of Judas’ secret conspiracy against Him, and some have suggested that He may have deliberately changed His place of abode to thwart Judas’ plans (see John 6:64).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
For the location of this Passover Christ gave instructions to go into the city to a certain man. Jesus did not name the person He had in mind, but gave a sign by which the two disciples dispatched on this errand might recognize him when they met him. On the basis of Acts 12:12 (cf. Acts 1:13), tradition has conjectured that the father of John Mark was the owner of the house, and that in his house was the upper room that became the abode of the Twelve and the headquarters of the church in Jerusalem for a time. See on Mark 14:51.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The preparation probably included the following: searching the room for leaven, sweeping the room, and furnishing it with a table, couches or cushions, and the utensils needed for serving the meal. Though Inspiration says nothing specifically of a lamb in connection with the supper Jesus ate with His disciples, it seems doubtful that they would have celebrated the paschal meal without one (see Mark 14:12, 16, 17, 18 Luke 22:7, 8, 13–15). Accordingly, Peter and John would purchase a lamb, slay it, and roast it. They would also prepare unleavened bread, bitter herbs, sauce, and wine. These preparations doubtless occupied a considerable part of the day, and it was probably toward evening when Peter and John returned.</article>

    <shortdescription>Christ celebrates His last Passover on Earth with His disciples in the upper room of a house. As they begin to eat, Jesus tells them that one of the disciples will betray Him.</shortdescription>
    <article>The hour had come for the Passover meal. It was Thursday night. Jesus instituted the Christian ordinance of the Lord’s Supper during the course of the regular Passover meal. The group reclined at a table as was common in ancient Oriental feasts (see Mark 2:15). At the first Passover meal the participants were to stand as they ate, ready to take their departure from Egypt. After entering the Promised Land, however, ever, they no longer stood, but sat or reclined. Whereas upon the first Passover their standing posture indicated their haste to depart, the reclining posture now indicated composure and security in the land promised to them.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This proved to be the last occasion on which all the Twelve were together in one place. It was the final time on which Jesus would be together with His beloved disciples before the agony of betrayal, trial, and crucifixion. This, the climax of His earthly ministry, had ever been before Him as He labored among men. For nearly a year Jesus had diligently been seeking to prepare His followers for the events of these final hours of His life. This was the fourth Passover of Jesus’ ministry, the third celebrated with the disciples in Jerusalem. Not all of them, however, had been present as members of this group upon either of the previous occasions—the Passovers of A.D. 28 and 29—which occurred prior to the selection and appointment of the Twelve in the summer of A.D. 29. It was definitely the Passover meal that Jesus and the Twelve now celebrated together on this occasion.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This was the last Passover season in which followers of Christ might meaningfully participate. The rent veil in the Temple at the moment of Christ’s death upon the cross (see on Matt. 27:51) was Heaven’s sign that the symbols of the Jewish religious system became obsolete when Christ, to whom all these things pointed (see Col. 2:17), gave His life a ransom for many. Jesus was about to replace the symbols of the dead past with the living symbols of His own body and His shed blood. The final and complete celebration of deliverance from sin was to take place in the kingdom of “glory,” concerning which Christ had already told the disciples (see on Matt. 25:31). This statement by Jesus is probably a reference to “the marriage supper of the Lamb” (see Rev. 19:7–9), held in commemoration of the fact that “the Lord God omnipotent reigneth” (see vs. 1–6).</article>

    <shortdescription>While preparing to celebrate the Passover, the disciples argue over who will be the greatest in God's kingdom. Jesus puts on a towel and begins to wash each disciple's feet, teaching them that servants are the great ones in God's kingdom.</shortdescription>
    <article>Christ washed His disciples feet. This incident occurred in connection with the paschal supper on Thursday night of the Passion Week. Earlier in His ministry Jesus had declared that His hour had not yet come (see on ch. 2:4). Now the crisis hour had arrived. This same night He would be betrayed into the hands of His enemies, and before the Jewish day, which began at sunset, should pass, Jesus would rest in Joseph’s tomb.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The washing of the feet probably took place early in the meal, in connection with the paschal supper (see Luke 22:24). Not all details of procedure during the Last Supper are noted by the gospel writers hence it cannot be definitely known at what point during the paschal ritual (see on Matt. 26:21)—if indeed the customary ritual was minutely followed by Jesus on the occasion—the Lord’s Supper was introduced. Jesus rose from the table and laid aside his outer garment. He took a towel and began to wash the disciples' feet. According to Jewish custom extending back probably to the time of Jesus, the washing of the master’s feet was one of the duties of a foreign slave, but was not one expected of a Jewish slave. However, it was a service a wife owed her husband, and children their father. The service was thus regarded as menial. Inasmuch as no servant was present on the occasion of the Last Supper, one of the disciples should have undertaken the task, but none volunteered.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus begins a new service for His followers that we call "The Lord's Supper." As He fulfills His work of redemption by being the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world, Jesus gives His disciples bread and grape juice that symbol His death.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jesus ate the Passover supper with His disciples before the Crucifixion. He took some of the unleavened Passover bread and blessed it, probably with the traditional Jewish blessing, “Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, king of the world, who dost bring forth bread from the earth.” Then He invited the disciples to take and eat the bread. As the body finds nourishment in literal bread, so the soul is to find spiritual nourishment in the truths Christ uttered.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This is my body. Some have interpreted literally this figurative statement of Jesus, forgetful, apparently, that He often spoke figuratively regarding Himself. For example: Jesus said, “I am the door” (John 10:7), and the “way” (John 14:6). But all agree He was not thereby transforming Himself into a door or a highway. That Jesus spoke figuratively regarding the “bread” becomes transparently evident from Luke 22:20 (cf. 1 Cor. 11:25), “This cup is the new testament in my blood.” If the bread actually became His very body, by the same process the “cup” must literally have become the “new testament.” The verb “is” in the phrase “this is my body” is used in the sense of “represents,” as it is in Mark 4:15–18 Luke 12:1 Gal. 4:24.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The cup was used in the celebration of the paschal service. It contained the pure juice of the grape untouched by fermentation, and probably diluted with water in accordance with contemporary Jewish custom. The method used in ancient times to preserve grape juice in an unfermented state from the vintage some six months prior to the Passover season is not known. In certain parts of the ancient East today, however, this is accomplished by partially dehydrating fresh grape juice and preserving it in a semi-jelly state. The addition of the requisite amount of water restores it to its original state. Grape juice can also be made from raisins.</article>

    <shortdescription>While celebrating the Passover with His disciples, Jesus predicts that one of them will betray Him. They wonder who it is and ask Christ. He tells them it is the one who dips bread in the dish when He does. Judas is the betrayer.</shortdescription>
    <article>According to the record this is the first time Jesus clearly announced that one of the Twelve was to be His betrayer. All were startled, but none as yet suspected Judas. The latter, however, now began to realize that Jesus read his dark secret as an open book. Jesus’ five statements revealing the conspirator were spoken in the following progressive order: (1) The words, “Ye are not all clean” (John 13:11), were uttered during the course of the foot washing. (2) The next statement, “He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me” (John 13:18), was made as the disciples again took their places at the table. (3) The announcement of Matt. 26:21, “One of you shall betray me,” followed a few moments later. (4) The words, “He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me” (v. 23), probably came at some point during the Lord’s Supper. (5) The final acknowledgment, “Thou hast said” (v. 25), came at the close of the Lord’s Supper and prompted Judas to leave the room forthwith.</article>

    <shortdescription>As Jesus approaches the Garden of Gethsemane, He tells them they will all stumble and forsake Him. Peter emphatically says, "Not me." But Christ predicts that Peter will deny Him three times before the rooster crows the next morning.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jesus spoke words of warning and admonition as He and the disciples began the descent from the city to the Kidron Valley on the way to the Mount of Olives. The time was probably an hour or more before midnight, during the early hours of Nisan 14. Jesus cites Zech. 13:7 and applies this prediction to the flight of the disciples at the moment of His arrest, an hour or more later (v. 56). Facing betrayal, condemnation, and death, Jesus speaks with confident assurance of His resurrection. The definite appointment here made with the disciples to meet them again in Galilee might have been for the disciples a source of encouragement during the hours of bitter disappointment that lay immediately ahead of them, but they apparently forgot it (see on v. 33).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Peter told Christ he would never deny Him. Peter was often spokesman for the disciples (see chs. 14:28 16:16, 22 17:4, 24). Here, however, it seems that he spoke on his own behalf exclusively, as feeling superior to his fellow disciples. Jesus’ words recorded in ch. 26:31, 32 apparently made no real impression on him. His impulsive reply was characteristic (see on Mark 3:16), but ill-considered. Peter meant well, to be sure, but he knew not whereof he spoke. How little the disciples knew of circumstances soon to develop that would lead them to forsake Jesus and flee for their lives (Mark 14:50).</article>

    <shortdescription>In Christ's final hour of teaching His disciples, he describes the relationship of believers to Himself as a grape vine with branches that are attached and bear fruit. He explains that without Him they can do nothing. They must love one another.</shortdescription>
    <article>The teaching of the "true vine" is another of the famous ‘I am’ sayings of Jesus (see on ch. 6:20 cf. chs. 8:12 10:7, 11 11:25 14:6). In Bible imagery Israel had been likened to a vine (Ps. 80:8–16 Isa. 5:1–7 27:2, 3 Jer. 2:21 12:10). A golden vine decorated the entrance to Herod’s Temple and figures of the leaves of the vine or of clusters of grapes were displayed on coins and architecture. The Jews depended upon their connection with the vine of Israel for their salvation. But Israel had proved unfaithful to its spiritual advantages and had rejected its true king, Jesus. Now Jesus presented Himself as the genuine vine. Only through vital connection with Him could men be saved.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus warns His disciples in His last teaching before dying on the cross that the world will hate and persecute them because it hates Jesus. But He assures them that He will send a Helper, the Holy Spirit, to sustain them.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jesus warns His disciples that there would be hatred from the world, but among the inner group there ought to be love (v. 17). They would have sufficient to endure from the bitter conflict with the world, without adding to the antagonism from without (Luke 22:24). The world hates those whose sympathies and interests are at variance with it. The full fury of the world’s hatred the disciples were yet to see.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Christ warned of persecution to come. He did not want the disciples to become discouraged when the full force of persecution should break loose upon them. How effectively this lesson was learned was later to be seen in the undaunted courage with which the disciples faced imprisonment, beating, torture, and death (Acts 5:41 16:22–25 etc.). In the face of unparalleled persecution (2 Cor. 4:8–12 1 Cor. 11:23–28) Paul could say, “For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory” (2 Cor. 4:17). Fearful that afflictions would overwhelm the infant church at Thessalonica, Paul wrote to the believers, “That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto” (1 Thess. 3:3 cf. Phil. 1:29 2 Tim. 3:12).</article>

    <shortdescription>As Christ completes His final teaching to the disciples before His arrest, He assures them of the help of the Holy Spirit. He tells them He will leave this world, but not leave them alone. The Spirit will comfort and guide them into truth.</shortdescription>
    <article>The death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ were important events in the outworking of the plan of salvation. Without these the era of the Spirit would not have become a reality. His departure was thus to the disciples’ profit and advantage. In His incarnate body Jesus could not be everywhere present, but through the medium of the Spirit Jesus could be with each one of His followers at all times and in all places (see Matt. 28:20). According to the plan of God, Jesus was to complete His work on earth and ascend to the Father’s throne before the Spirit should come. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The day of Pentecost, the day when the gift of the Spirit was bestowed, provided a striking exhibit of this aspect of the Spirit’s work. Those who heard Peter’s address were “pricked in their heart” (Acts 2:37). One of the first evidences of the operation of the Holy Spirit is the deep conviction that one is a sinner. Thus the Spirit convicts men of their sin, points them to the salvation and righteousness that is in Jesus, and warns them of the consequences of continuing in their sins and of neglecting the salvation freely offered.</article>

    <shortdescription>In Christ's great intercessory prayer before His betrayal and trial, Jesus prays for Himself, His disciples, and all His believers. It is Jesus' longest recorded prayer. It concludes Christ's last teaching to the disciples.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jesus' intercessory prayer concludes His parting counsel begun in the upper room and continued on the way to Gethsemane. This prayer is the longest of the prayers of Jesus on record. Bengel says with regard to ch. 17 that of all chapters in Scripture it is the easiest in regard to words the most profound in regard to ideas. The prayer naturally divides itself into three parts: (1) prayer for Himself (vs. 1–5) (2) prayer for the disciples (vs. 6–19) (3) prayer for all believers (vs. 20–26).</article>

    <shortdescription>As Jesus enters the Garden of Gethsemane with His disciples, the weight of the sins of the world are falling on Him. He asks three disciples to pray with Him. Three times they fall asleep and three times He asks for them to watch and pray.</shortdescription>
    <article>Gethsemane comes from an Aramaic word meaning “oil press.” To this spot the Saviour had frequently resorted for meditation, prayer, and rest, and here He had often spent the night (Luke 22:39 John 18:2 DA 685, 686). It seems probable that this was His place of retirement Tuesday and Wednesday nights preceding the crucifixion (see Luke 21:37 see on Matt 21:17 24:1, 3 26:17, 18). The exact location of the garden of Bible times is not known. This quiet spot was probably situated somewhere on the lower slope of the Mount of Olives (see on chs. 21:1 26:30), directly across the Kidron Valley from the Temple and about ten minutes’ walk from the city. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As they entered the garden eight of the disciples were bidden to remain near, probably just inside, the gate of the garden. Christ then took with him Peter, James, and John who enjoyed the privilege of a more intimate association with Jesus than the other disciples. Jesus expressed the weight that was coming upon Him. It is impossible for us to comprehend the profound sorrow, the mysterious grief, that bore down upon Jesus as He entered the Garden of Gethsemane. The strange sadness that overtook Him puzzled the disciples. Here was the divine-human Son of God, Son of man (see on Matt 1:1 Mark 2:10 Luke 1:35), suffering an intensity of distress they had never witnessed before. In part, the suffering was physical, but this was only the visible reflection of the infinite suffering of Christ as the bearer of the sins of the world.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It is impossible for us as sinful beings to comprehend the intensity of our Saviour’s anguish as He bore the weight of the sins of the world (see on Luke 22:43). He asked for human sympathy and companionship in the struggle with the powers of darkness. To “watch” means, literally, “to stay awake,” but here it means to remain awake for a purpose, and that purpose is to share Christ’s vigil. Luke adds that the distance was about a stone’s throw (Luke 22:41). He was within sight and hearing of Peter, James, and John they saw the angel (Luke 22:43), and heard His voice. Three times He asked the disciples to watch and pray before He was arrested.</article>

    <shortdescription>After Christ is betrayed by Judas, He is led to Annas, the leader of the Sanhedrin &amp; father-in-law of Caiaphas where He is questioned. During this time Peter waits outside. He is warming by a fire when he is asked if he knows Jesus. He denies Christ.</shortdescription>
    <article>After Christ's arrest, He is first brought before Annas was the father-in-law of Caiphas. The Romans did not recognize Annas, but the Jews considered his position to be lifelong. Jesus was questioned by the High Priest about His disciples and doctrine. Jesus had taught privately, to be sure, a notable example being His conversation with Nicodemus (ch. 3). Here He denies the implied charge of secretly planning sedition. His reply was a rebuke to the sinister means by which the Jews had sought to ensnare Him. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
There seems to be an appeal here to Jewish judicial law by Christ in His response. According to the interpretation of Maimonides, a Jewish scholar of the 12th century A.D., the law did not inflict the penalty of death upon a sinner by his own confession. Some have questioned whether this principle was operative in the time of Jesus. The principle seems to be implied in the Mishnah (see, for example, Sanhedrin 6. 1, 2, Soncino ed. of the Talmud, pp. 275, 281, 283, 284), and there is reason to believe that it was valid earlier. Viewing the matter legally, we might here think of Jesus as appealing for His rights, and as asking the court to secure the proper witnesses.</article>

    <shortdescription>In a night trial before the Sanhedrin (the council of Jewish leaders), Jesus stands before Caiaphas and is questioned. False witnesses are brought in to testify against Jesus. After demanding that Jesus speak, the high priest condemns Christ.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jesus was seized around midnight. His trial consisted of two phases, the first being the ecclesiastical trial before the Jewish religious authorities, and the second the civil trial before Pilate and Herod. He was given two preliminary hearings, one before Annas alone and another before Annas and Caiaphas and was arraigned twice before the Sanhedrin, first by night and then by day. He appeared twice before Pilate and once before Herod, between the two appearances before Pilate.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In this first night trial Christ was brought before Caiaphas. The Sanhedrin was composed of members from these two groups, and from the priests. All three are listed in the parallel passage in Mark (ch. 14:53). They assembled for this night trial of Jesus, at approximately 3 A.M. Members of the Sanhedrin who were friendly toward Jesus, or at least interested in giving Him a fair hearing, were deliberately not invited (see on v. 66).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This “council” was the Great Sanhedrin, which normally consisted of 71 members, and which was, at this time, the highest executive, legislative, and judicial body. For two years the Sanhedrin had spies following Jesus, in order that all He said and did might be reported. But these spies had not returned with any information useful to the leaders’ evil purposes. They determined to put Him to death. But they had no case against Jesus, much as they might dislike Him, and in their haste had not had time to manufacture one. They hoped to discredit Jesus in the eyes of His fellow countrymen by proving the charge of blasphemy, and to incriminate Him before the Romans on the charge of sedition. They were unable to find even false witnesses whose tales could be made to agree. Finally, two witnesses came forward, but even these last two actually disagreed (Mark 14:59) on essential points, and their testimony was vague and contradictory. Nevertheless, the high priest pretended to accept their testimony (Matt. 26:62), although he knew well that Jesus could not be sentenced on the basis of it.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Caiaphas demanded that Jesus reply under oath to the question now put to Him. In spite of the testimony of all the false witnesses, the Sanhedrin still had no case against Jesus. Caiaphas hoped to make Jesus incriminate Himself. This, too, was illegal. A man could not be condemned on His own testimony. Caiaphas pretended to arraign Christ before the bar of God. Jesus had avoided making the direct claim to being the Messiah, or Christ, perhaps in part because in popular fancy Messiah was to lead the Jews in an armed revolt against Rome. Jesus forbade His disciples to make the claim for Him (ch. 16:20). This was not the first time the question had been put to Jesus (see John 10:24). When placed under oath Jesus did not refuse to testify in fact, that is precisely when He did testify. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Caiphas then tore his clothes. This is, as a sign of being overcome with righteous indignation at Jesus’ alleged blasphemy (see v. 64). The Mosaic law prohibited the high priest from tearing his garments (Lev. 10:6 21:10), the reason being that his garments represented the perfect character of Jesus Christ. Caiaphas thus stood condemned before the very law he posed as defending, and disqualified himself from serving as high priest. However, rabbinical regulations permitted one hearing blasphemy to rend his garments. But Jesus had not blasphemed, either in reality or according to the accepted rabbinical definition (see on Matt. 26:65). This was an illegal vote, for it was taken at night. Even though voted, the verdict did not have standing in law unless and until it was ratified by the Romans.</article>

    <shortdescription>After a night trial, the Sanhedrin gathers to council and decides to bind Jesus and take Him to Pontius Pilate, the governor of Judea.</shortdescription>
    <article>The night trial before selected members of the Sanhedrin (see on Matt. 26:57–75), held in the home of the high priest, was not an official session, in spite of the fact that testimony was heard and a decision rendered. It was necessary to issue a formal call for a meeting of the Sanhedrin as soon as the sun rose, about 5:30 A.M. at that time of year in the latitude of Jerusalem. Hence, the essential features of the night trial had to be repeated. The day trial, therefore, resembles, in its main features, the night trial. That the night session was a meeting of the Sanhedrin is indicated in the statement that “as soon as it was day, the Sanhedrin again assembled”.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Christ was led from the guardroom at the palace of the high priest to the council chamber of the Sanhedrin. Here He was questioned, "Are you the Christ?" The night session had already considered the reply Christ gave to this question as an adequate reason for condemning Him to death (see on Matt. 26:63–66). The question was repeated for all to hear. Many members of the Sanhedrin were now present who had not been present at the night session, though Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathaea had not been summoned. Jesus had already told them once, an hour or more earlier (see on Matt. 26:64). They were not interested in the facts in the case and would refuse to examine the evidence. Jesus had discussed the evidences of His Messiahship, probably in this very hall, two years before (see on John 5:17–47, esp. vs. 31–39).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jesus answered "You say that I am." This is simply an idiomatic way of saying “Yes” (see Mark 14:62 Matt. 26:64). The “Son of man” is “the Christ” (Luke 22:67). See on Matt. 1:1 Mark 2:10. This was Jesus’ third condemnation at the hands of the Jewish leaders, and the third scene of abuse and mockery followed hard upon it. Except for the restraining presence of the Roman soldiers, Jesus would doubtless have been murdered by the mob in the very presence of the Sanhedrin. Had Jesus not been what He claimed to be, the Jewish leaders would have been absolutely right. But because He was all He claimed to be, they were eternally and irretrievably wrong.</article>

    <shortdescription>The Jewish leaders take Christ to Pilate, the governor of Judea, to have Jesus condemned to death. He questions Jesus and tries to get Christ to defend Himself. Jesus remains silent.</shortdescription>
    <article>The Jewish leaders led Christ to Pilate to be tried. Luke lists three of the charges preferred against Jesus by the Jewish authorities. Here, they charge Him with being a revolutionary agitator. Throughout His ministry Jesus had taken great care to avoid providing any valid basis for such a charge as the one now brought against Him (see on Matt. 14:22 16:20 Mark 1:45 6:42 John 6:15). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This fabricated charge was directly related to the false Messianic concepts entertained by the Jewish leaders (see on Luke 4:19). Three days before this the Pharisees had done their best to lure Jesus into making the statement they here claim that He did make, but their attempt met with inglorious defeat (see on Matt. 22:15–22). Second, Jesus was charged with saying that He was against paying tribute to Caesar.  The third charge was that Christ claimed to be king. Jesus had never made such a claim directly. They were no doubt thinking of His triumphal entry into Jerusalem but five days before this, an event that all members of the Jewish nation took as equivalent to a declaration by Jesus that He was assuming the throne of David (see on Matt. 21:5, 9).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The mob was fierce and urgent in their demands. They persistently insisted that Pilate accede to their demands. They claimed Jesus stirred up the people. This charge was, of course, all too true, though not in the sense that the leaders would have Pilate believe. During recent weeks, particularly since the resurrection of Lazarus, popular opinion was increasingly favorable to Jesus. Previously, the priests and rulers themselves had ruefully admitted to one another that “the world is gone after him” (John 12:19).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jewry. Literally, Judea here probably used inclusively of all Israelite Palestine (see on chs. 1:5 7:17). To be sure, Luke also uses the term in reference to Judea proper (see Luke 2:4 Acts 1:8 8:1). However, Luke seems to be the only New Testamentwriter to use the term in the broader sense.</article>

    <shortdescription>While listening to Christ's accusers, Pilate hears that Jesus is from Galilee and so he sends Christ to Herod to be tried. Herod is curious about Jesus &amp; hopes to see a miracle. But Christ is silent. Herod and the soldiers mock Jesus &amp; send Him back.</shortdescription>
    <article>Only Luke records this hearing before Herod Antipas in the trial of Jesus. The most successful and impressive part of Christ’s ministry had been in Galilee. Herod’s jurisdiction included Galilee and Peraea. Herod had now been living in adultery for some time (see on Matt. 14:3 Mark 6:17). About a year had passed since his murder of John the Baptist (see on Mark 6:1, 29), and his conscience continued to trouble him over the matter. At first he had feared that Jesus might be John the Baptist raised from the dead (see on Mark 6:14, 16). For some time Herod had earnestly desired an opportunity to have an interview with Jesus (see on Luke 9:9). He wanted to see a miracle. Curiosity seems to have been another motive that prompted Herod in his desire to have an interview with Jesus.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Herod ordered Jesus unbound and then proceeded to question Him at length before he permitted the Jews to present their charges against Him. But Christ answered him nothing. In addition to the reasons that had prompted Jesus to remain silent before the Sanhedrin and before Pilate (see on Matt. 26:63 27:13), was the additional reason that Herod had heard and rejected the message of John the Baptist. He had rejected the light of truth God had permitted to shine upon his path, and for a soul thus hopelessly hardened in sin Jesus had no words. This silence was a severe rebuke to the haughty monarch, and, together with Jesus’ refusal to perform a miracle at his request, angered Herod and turned him against Jesus.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Like Pilate, Herod was satisfied that malice alone prompted the charges against Jesus, but the silence of Jesus irritated him, for it appeared that Jesus slighted his authority.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
A gorgeous robe was cast onto Jesus. Possibly this was one of Herod’s cast-off garments. In appearance it must have seemed gaudy in comparison with the simple, unostentatious garments Jesus usually wore. Unless the Roman soldiers had intervened, as they had at the close of the day trial before the Sanhedrin (see on ch. 22:71), Jesus would not doubt have been killed by the mob during the course of the wild demonstration pictured here. But, like Pilate, Herod chose to evade responsibility, and sent Jesus back to Pilate.</article>

    <shortdescription>In Jesus' second trial before Pilate, the governor thinks to free Christ by offering to release one of two prisoners. The crowd votes for Barabbas and shouts to crucify Christ. Pilate washes his hands and sends Christ away to be executed.</shortdescription>
    <article>The Gospels mention Pilate principally in connection with the trial of Jesus. At that time he was in the midst of his term of office. Knowing that he was extremely unpopular, he was anxious to please the Jews in a matter that cost him nothing, although he realized that the accusations brought against Jesus were false.</article>

    <shortdescription>After Pilate's trial, soldiers strip Jesus, put a scarlet robe on Him and a crown of thorns and mockingly bow to Him as King of the Jews. They whip Him and lead Him away to be crucified with two thieves.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jesus was crucified. Crucifixion is the act of fixing a condemned person to a cross, either by tying the hands and feet to it or by fixing them to it by driving nails through them. As with Christ, it was common to scourge victims prior to crucifixion, and then to require them to carry the cross, or one beam of it, to the place of execution (Jn 19:1, 17). In 1968 several Jewish tombs were discovered north of Jerusalem. One of them, dating to the 1st cent. A.D., contained the bones of a man by the name of Jehohanan, who at the time of death was 24 to 28 years old. The evidence showed that he had been crucified. Both his heel bones were discovered transfixed by a large nail and the shin bones were found intentionally broken. It was the first time that the remains of a crucified individual were found in an archaeological excavation in Palestine.</article>

    <shortdescription>After Christ dies on the cross of Calvary, His body is lovingly removed from the cross and placed in a garden tomb belonging to a man named Joseph. The body is wrapped in a clean cloth. A large stone covers the entrance and soldiers stand guard.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jesus died late Friday afternoon, the day of the crucifixion, at about 3:00 P.M. (see Mark 15:34–37) The sun set about 6:30 at this season of the year in the latitude of Jerusalem. Mark describes a rich man requesting the body of Christ, Joseph of Arimathaea, “an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God” (Mark 15:43). Luke adds that he was “a good man, and a just,” who “had not consented to the counsel and deed” of the leaders (Luke 23:50, 51). John describes him as “a disciple of Jesus, … secretly for fear of the Jews” (John 19:38). The provision for the interment of Jesus, arranged by Joseph of Arimathaea, fulfilled Isaiah’s prediction (ch. 53:9) that Messiah would make “his grave … with the rich in his death.” John adds that Nicodemus (see John 3:1 7:50) was associated with Joseph in arranging for the burial of Jesus (ch. 19:39).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Nicodemus went to purchase spices for embalming the body of Jesus (see on John 19:39, 40), probably at the same time Joseph went to see Pilate. Time was short, as the task must be completed before sundown (see on Matt. 27:57). It must have taken courage to step forward and manifest sympathy for a man who had been condemned and executed as a traitor to Rome, and who had been branded by the highest Jewish court as a blasphemer. The courage of Joseph and Nicodemus shines with added luster in contrast with the cowardice of the disciples.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
About the same time the Jewish leaders came to Pilate with the request that the bodies of Jesus and the two thieves be removed from the cross before the Sabbath (John 19:31). The law of Moses required that the bodies of impaled criminals be removed before sundown (Deut. 21:22, 23). It would be considered particularly offensive for the bodies to remain on the crosses over Sabbath, especially in view of the fact that this Sabbath was “an high day” (John 19:31, 42). In the normal course of events Jesus, as a traitor to Rome, would have been given a dishonorable burial in a field reserved for the basest of criminals. Before ordering Joseph to take custody of Jesus’ body, Pilate secured from the centurion official confirmation of His death (Mark 15:44, 45). It was unusual that a crucified person should die within six hours. Usually the agony of death continued for many hours longer, sometimes for several days.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Luke (ch. 23:53) explains that no one had yet been buried in the tomb. Upon entering a typical tomb, one would probably find a recess in the walls on each side, in which bodies were laid. Often there was a small room behind the main part of the tomb where the bones of previous generations were collected, to make room for new arrivals at the grave. Joseph’s generous gift of a burial place solved a problem for which the disciples had no solution. A great stone was rolled in front of the tomb. Probably a stone resembling a grindstone in shape, so placed as to roll into position in a small groove to close the door of the tomb. Mary Magdalene, that is, Mary the sister of Martha was one of the last to leave the tomb Friday afternoon, as she was first to return there Sunday morning.</article>

    <shortdescription>After Jesus dies and is placed in a garden tomb, the Pharisees ask Pilate to station soldiers to guard the tomb for fear that the disciples will steal the body and say Christ arose from the dead. Pilate gives them permission to secure the tomb.</shortdescription>
    <article>The "Guard at the Tomb of Christ" incident is recorded only by Matthew. The “Next day” was the weekly Sabbath day (see Luke 23:54, 56). Critics have made elaborate attempts to discredit the incident Matthew here relates. The critics have branded as incredible that the Jewish authorities knew that Jesus had predicted His resurrection, that they would go to Pilate on the Sabbath day, that Pilate would grant their request, that the Roman soldiers would conspire to make a false report, even for a bribe, and that they were terrified and fell to the ground when the angel appeared to roll away the stone. To be sure, so far as the inspired record itself goes, Matthew is our sole source. But it may be pointed out that both Pilate and the Jewish authorities are here found acting entirely in character, and this fact constitutes strong internal evidence of the genuineness of the story. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Gospel record makes evident that there were no lengths to which the priests and rulers would not go. Furthermore, their deep apprehension throughout the preceding two days, that they might not succeed in their sinister plot to destroy Jesus, together with their suspicion that He was indeed the Messiah, would lead them to do the very thing Matthew here ascribes to them. Pilate had feebly acquiesced in their insistent demands for the blood of Jesus (see John 19:12), and they had every reason to believe that he would comply with this request also. It was the Passover season, and in view of past difficulties he had experienced with the Jews he would no doubt go to the most unreasonable lengths to appease them.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus dies on the cross on Friday afternoon. Early Sunday morning an angel descends from heaven and rolls back the stone and calls Jesus from the tomb. The soldiers fall as dead to the ground. Christ rises from the dead.</shortdescription>
    <article>The Bible teaches that the resurrection of Christ from the grave is a literal historical fact. The guarded but empty tomb, with the graveclothes left behind in an orderly manner (John 20:6, 7), convinced John of the Resurrection (John 20:8, 9). The theories that Jesus swooned but did not die, that the body was stolen by the disciples, that an empty tomb was mistaken for the one in which Jesus had been placed, or that Joseph of Arimathaea removed the body require more faith to believe than acceptance of the events recorded in the NT. There was, as well, the testimony of the Roman guard (Matt. 28:11f.), the announcement of the angels at the tomb (verses 4–7), and the testimony of those resurrected with Christ (Matt. 27:52, 53). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Even stronger evidence is found in the 10 post-Resurrection appearances of our Lord. Five of these took place on the day of the Resurrection—to Mary Magdalene (John 20:11–18), to the other women (Matt. 28:8–10), to Simon Peter (Luke 24:33–35 1 Cor. 15:5), to Cleopas and a companion on the way to Emmaus (Luke 24:33–34), and to the 10 disciples in Jerusalem (John 20:19–31). Five additional appearances came later—to the 11 in Jerusalem (John 20:26–28), to the seven by the Sea of Galilee (John 21:1–23), to more than 500 on a mountain in Galilee (Matt. 28:16–20 1 Cor. 15:6), to James (1 Cor. 15:7), and to the 11 in Jerusalem and Bethany (Luke 24:44–49).</article>

    <shortdescription>After Jesus rises from the dead, He appears to different people, including two men who are walking to Emmaus. They do not know Jesus is walking with them. Christ speaks encouraging words and finally reveals Himself to them. They rejoice!</shortdescription>
    <article>Emmaus was a village to which Cleopas and an unnamed companion traveled from Jerusalem after the resurrection of Jesus. While they were still on the road they were joined by the resurrected Christ, who conversed with them while accompanying them to Emmaus, their destination, where He revealed Himself to them. The village of Emmaus, according to the best textual evidence, lay 60 stadia (about 7 mi. [c. 11 km.]) from Jerusalem (Lk 24:13). The site has not yet been conclusively identified. Josephus (War vii. 6. 6) says that Titus had a colony of soldiers at ’Ammaous, 30 stadia (about 31/2 mi. [c. 5.5 km.]) from Jerusalem this is probably Qalôniyeh, about 5 mi. (c. 8 km.) to the northwest of Jerusalem. Since the time of the crusaders, Kubeibeh, 7 m. (c. 11 km.) northwest of Jerusalem on the Roman road, has been pointed out as Emmaus however, some scholars have identified it with the modern ‘Amwâs in the Shephelah (the Emmaus of 1 Macc 3:40, 57 etc.).</article>

    <shortdescription>Two men who saw Christ on their walk to Emmaus run back to Jerusalem to tell the eleven disciples that Jesus has indeed risen from the dead. The disciples are skeptical, but then Christ appears to them. He opens their eyes and minds to truth.</shortdescription>
    <article>The first appearance of Christ to the disciples in the upper room is doubtless the same as that described in Luke 24:36–48. The meeting took place after the two disciples returned from Emmaus, which was late at night (see on Luke 24:33). Because the disciples were afraid, the door was shut and locked. The place where they were assembled was the upper room where they had celebrated the Passover (see Luke 24:33). It seems unlikely that the disciples would have sought concealment in a place so well known as this. However, to have the doors barred against enemies is perfectly understandable. After showing them His hands and side, Christ breathed on them and said, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." This was a preliminary, partial fulfillment of the promise of chs. 14:16–18 16:7–15. The full outpouring came some 50 days later at Pentecost (Acts 2). “Ghost” should be rendered “Spirit” (see on John 14:26).</article>

    <shortdescription>One week after the resurrection, Christ appears once more to the disciples in an upper room. Thomas, who expressed doubt over Jesus resurrection, is present. Christ asks Thomas to touch His hand and side. Thomas believes.</shortdescription>
    <article>When Christ appeared to the disciples for the second time after the resurrection, Thomas had been doubting. God ever provides men with sufficient evidence on which to base faith, and those who are willing to accept it can always find their way to Him. At the same time God does not compel men to believe against their will, for in so doing He would deprive them of the right to make their own choice. Were all men like Thomas, later generations could never come to a saving knowledge of the Saviour. In fact, none but the few hundred who actually saw the risen Lord with their natural eyesight would have believed in Him. But for all who do receive Him by faith and believe on His name (see on ch. 1:12) Heaven reserves a special blessing—“Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed” (ch. 20:29).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
After Christ greeted them with, "Peace be unto you," He invited Thomas to come forward and touch Him. The Lord knew what was in the heart of Thomas, and upon arrival directed His attention immediately to the doubting disciple. He offered him the exact proof he demanded, unreasonable though his demand was (see v. 25). There is no evidence that Thomas took advantage of the offer. The fact that the Lord read the doubts of his heart so accurately was to him convincing evidence of the resurrection. His response, "My Lord and my God," was to use the title with its highest significance (see on ch. 13:13). Kurios (Lord), in the LXX, translates the Heb. YHWH, the divine name sometimes transliterated into English as Jehovah. By his confession Thomas associated the Being before him with the Jehovah of the OT. Such a confession later apparently became a standard formula of faith (see 1 Cor. 12:3).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jesus' responds with a blessing toward all who have "seen" Him. Apparently Thomas had not accepted the invitation to touch the nailprints, and the scar left by the spear thrust (v. 27). But he demanded at least the evidence of his sight. He was unwilling to believe on the witness of others alone. Jesus rebuked his faithlessness and commended those who were willing to believe without the corroboration of their senses.</article>

    <shortdescription>For a third time Christ appears to seven of His disciples by the Sea of Tiberias (Galilee). The disciples have gone fishing when Christ appears along the shore. He calls to them and they recognize Him and come and eat with Him.</shortdescription>
    <article>Between the second appearance in the upper room (ch. 20:26–29) and the appearance on a mountain in Galilee (Matt. 28:16–20) Christ revealed Himself to His disciples. This is evident from the fact that the incident is described as “the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples” (John 21:14).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The disciples went fishing, which had been Peter’s trade prior to becoming a disciple of Jesus (see Matt. 4:18–20). James and John had also been fishermen (Matt. 4:21). The purpose of the suggestion was doubtless to replenish their meager funds. The disciples were not abandoning their higher calling. They had come to Galilee to meet their Master.</article>

    <shortdescription>Christ makes an appearance on a mountain to His disciples and about 500 others. Jesus gives them the great commission at this time.</shortdescription>
    <article>The place of Christ's appearance on a mountain after the resurrection is not specified. It may have been some spot already closely associated in the minds of the disciples with the life ministry of Jesus, such as the place where the Sermon on the Mount was given (see on ch. 5:1), or where the Transfiguration occurred (see on ch. 17:1). About 500 believers were gathered together upon this occasion (1 Cor. 15:6). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
They were gathered, awaiting His arrival. Suddenly He appeared among them. Such had been the case with His previous post-resurrection appearances. In acknowledgment of His divinity and Messiah-ship they worshiped Him. Before the crucifixion and resurrection it was seldom that even the Twelve worshiped Jesus. Some doubted. This does not refer to the Eleven, all of whom were now convinced, but to others among the 500 believers assembled on the mountainside, many of whom had never before seen Jesus.</article>

    <shortdescription>Jesus meets one last time with His disciples on the slopes of the Mount of Olives near Bethany. He lifts His hands to bless them as He ascends up into heaven. The disciples then return to Jerusalem to begin their great work of spreading the gospel.</shortdescription>
    <article>The ascension of our Lord, which took place 40 days after the resurrection. By inclusive reckoning 40 days from a Sunday would end on a Thursday, which for centuries Christians have taken as the day of the ascension (Acts 1:3–11). The place from which Jesus ascended was the Mount of Olives (v 12), a spot in the vicinity of Bethany (Lk 24:50). The event was witnessed by the Eleven (Acts 1:12, 13) and possibly others. The ascension marks the close of our Lord’s earthly ministry and the beginning of His ministry in heaven on our behalf (Heb 4:14–16 9:24). As a historical event the ascension stands as an assurance that Christ will return to receive us (Acts 1:11 cf. Jn 14:1–3).</article>

    <shortdescription>The message to the church of Ephesus is one of purity and represents the church of the first century. It is admonished to remember its first love. Ephesus was an important seaport city in Asia Minor (modern day Western Turkey).</shortdescription>
    <article>The book of Revelation is presented as a letter to seven churches located in Asia Minor (see Revelation 1:4). While the entire book was intended for all seven churches to read, specific messages are found for each church in chapters 2 and 3. These ancient letters not only encouraged seven local churches when delivered 2,000 years ago, but have universal value to churches in all ages. The messages to these churches also appear to describe eras of church history from the time of Christ up to our day. The number seven is a key figure in the book of Revelation. It has deeper spiritual significance in prophecy. It is the “prince” of numbers in Scripture and represents completeness and perfection. The messages to the seven churches are perfect for all churches to read and study.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Letter to the Church of Ephesus&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
The first letter in Revelation 2:1-7 was written to the church of Ephesus, a seaport city in the southwest part of Asia Minor. It was a leading city and a focal point of trade. Like a giant circle (of about 50 miles around), the seven churches are each presented with a message going clockwise from Ephesus to Laodicea. Ephesus represents the new and pure church of the first century. The name “Ephesus” means “desirable.” The church is praised for its patience and hard work, but is rebuked for losing its first love.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Like each letter, this message begins with a brief description of a quality of Christ. “These things says He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lamp stands” (v. 1). Also, like the other letters, this one begins with a word of affirmation. The church of Ephesus is praised for their work and patience. They are not afraid of dealing with evil.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
But, Ephesus is rebuked for having left its “first love.” God calls them to repent and return to their “first works” or the lampstand in their midst will be removed. The fervor of this young church in spreading the gospel was strong and passionate when the outpouring of the Holy Spirit launched the new believers. But time and persecution began to cause some of the bright lights to go out. Some leaders were martyred, others became complacent. During the time of John on the island of Patmos it seemed like the lampstand (the light of the Holy Spirit) would be extinguished.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
But God had not forgotten His people. A message of warning was sent to challenge the new church to return to its first love. Like newlyweds who begin to forget the tender affections of the first years of marriage, this church needed to receive God’s love back into their hearts and be motivated to serve with a passion born of love for Jesus. The church in Ephesus was also affirmed for hating the deeds of the “Nicolaitans”, a group that was apparently introducing heresy into the church.&lt;BR /&gt;
Verse 7 ends with two messages. “He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.” In other words, these messages are for anyone who is willing to honestly listen to the Holy Spirit. The letter ends with a promise for overcomers. “To him who overcomes I will give to eat from the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.” Just as the church of Ephesus over came the “false teachings” being circulated, so must all believers not eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. When anyone overcomes, they will eat from the tree of life.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Loveless Churches and Christians Today&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Though the message to the church of Ephesus was written 2,000 years ago for a church in Asia Minor, the letter is relevant today, both for individual churches and every Christian. When churches are planted, they may spring up with a contagious zeal to witness and share the love of Christ. But churches may go through cycles and lose this first love. They must not forget the foundations of their early evangelistic work. The love of Jesus is not needed only when a church first begins, but must remain in the lifeblood of the organization throughout its entire life.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
So also must everyone who comes to Christ must stay with Christ. The early attentions of our love-relationship with Jesus need to stay alive during our entire walk with God. Spending time in the Bible study and prayer cannot be laid aside if we would maintain our faith. Sharing our witness with others and giving our personal testimony needs to stay fresh and alive or we will lose our first love and the light of God’s presence will go out from our lives. Will you maintain your first love with Jesus?</article>

    <shortdescription>Stephen stands before the Jewish council and speaks boldly about Jesus Christ. The council is "cut to the heart" and angry with him. They cast him out of the city and stone him. This is a final sealing of the Jewish nation's rejection of Christ.</shortdescription>
    <article>Stephen's speech aroused the indignation of the people and rulers. He was arrested and arraigned before the council (v 12). He was there confronted with charges of having spoken against the Temple and the Law, and of having taught that Jesus would destroy the Temple (chs 6:13–15 7:1). In his defense Stephen presented a re´sume´ of the history of God’s chosen people beginning with Abraham (ch 7:2), and endeavored to show that the Hebrews had consistently rejected God’s leadership and had now rejected His Messiah.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Sensing, evidently by the reaction of his listeners, that his defense had failed and that his enemies were determined to take his life, Stephen abruptly ended his line of reasoning and began a severe indictment of his accusers (Acts 7:51–53). Finally, as his enemies manifested hottest anger (v 54), he, “being full of the Holy Ghost,” was given a vision of Jesus at God’s right hand (v 55). He described this vision to his audience, who stopped their ears at what they considered blasphemy, dragged him out of the city, and stoned him (vs 56–58). “And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him” (ch 8:2). Stephen’s death, which took place only a few years after the earthly life of Jesus, began the first wave of persecution to overtake the church. The believers were forced to leave Jerusalem, and thus the seed of the gospel of Jesus Christ was spread farther afield (v 1).</article>

    <shortdescription>The Bible foretells events that will take place before Christ's return. Most of these prophecies are found in Daniel and Revelation, but also in Matthew 24, Mark 13, and Luke 21. </shortdescription>
    <article>Believing that “all scripture is given by inspiration of God” (2 Tim. 3:16), most Christians accept the validity of Bible prophecy (here understood in the limited sense of predictive prophecy). The Bible is replete with instances when God foretold future events to enable humans to cooperate intelligently with His divine purpose for them. However, when Christians speak of “prophecies and prophetic interpretation,” they refer most often to the prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation and to scattered eschatological passages elsewhere in both the Old and the New Testaments.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Paul persecutes the church and consents to Stephen's stoning and death. On the way to Damascus Paul meets Christ and falls down in blindness. The Lord tells Him what to do and where to go. Later Ananias prays for his healing and baptizes him.</shortdescription>
    <article>It was on one of these persecuting excursions that the course of Paul’s life was spectacularly and completely changed. Hearing that there were Christians in Damascus, he sought from the high priest letters—evidently letters of extradition—authorizing him to arrest and bring to Jerusalem any Christian found in that city (Acts 9:1, 2). As Paul approached Damascus at midday with a company of men to aid him in his murderous designs, he was suddenly surrounded by a blinding light, brighter than the sun. Paul and his companions fell to the earth (ch 26:14), and a voice, identifying its owner as Jesus of Nazareth, inquired, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?” adding, “It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.” Paul, overwhelmed by the experience, asked what he was to do, upon which Jesus informed him that he was to become a witness for Him to the Gentiles (vs 16, 17). He was instructed to go into Damascus, where he would receive further information. Meanwhile his amazed and fearful companions, who had arisen from the ground (see ch 9:7), understood nothing of what was taking place, for although they saw the light and heard the words of Jesus, they could not understand what was being said (cf. chs 9:7 22:9). Rising to his feet, Paul discovered that he was blind.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In that condition Paul was led by his companions to the home of a certain Judas in Damascus, where he stayed 3 days without food or drink (Acts 9:8, 9, 11). While Paul was engaged in prayer, Jesus appeared in vision to one Ananias and directed him to the home of Judas, on the “street which is called Straight,” where he would find Paul, who had been given a vision of his coming. Ananias respectfully reminded Jesus of Paul’s acts of persecution, but was informed that the erstwhile persecutor had been chosen of God (vs 11–16). Following instructions, Ananias found Paul and laid his hands upon him, whereupon Paul’s sight was immediately restored and he received the gift of the Holy Spirit and was baptized (vs 17, 18).</article>

    <shortdescription>After Saul (Paul) is converted he immediately preaches of Christ in Damascus. He spends 3 years in Arabia. Back in Damascus his life is threatened and he escapes by being let over the city wall in a basket at night. He then goes to Jerusalem.</shortdescription>
    <article>After encountering Christ and becoming blind, Paul was led by his companions to the home of a certain Judas in Damascus, where he stayed 3 days without food or drink (Acts 9:8, 9, 11). While Paul was engaged in prayer, Jesus appeared in vision to one Ananias and directed him to the home of Judas, on the “street which is called Straight,” where he would find Paul, who had been given a vision of his coming. Ananias respectfully reminded Jesus of Paul’s acts of persecution, but was informed that the erstwhile persecutor had been chosen of God (vs 11–16). Following instructions, Ananias found Paul and laid his hands upon him, whereupon Paul’s sight was immediately restored and he received the gift of the Holy Spirit and was baptized (vs 17, 18).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
How long Paul remained in Damascus after this is not known. The record seems to indicate that it was a brief period (Acts 9:19). We know that he associated with the Christians there. Also, true to his character—and to the wonderment of those who knew him—he began to preach in the synagogues the Christ he had once vilified but had recently come to worship (vs 19–21). So powerfully and convincingly did he preach that none could defeat his logic or deny his power (v 22).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
3. Preparation and Early Preaching. The narrative in Acts omits the next event in Paul’s life, but Paul refers to it in the book of Galatians, where he says that following his conversion and his first brief evangelistic venture, he went into Arabia and returned to Damascus (Gal 1:17), before his trip to Jerusalem recorded in Acts 9:26 Gal 1:18. The exact area referred to as “Arabia” is unknown (although it was most likely the country of the Nabataeans), as is the length of time he remained there. This period of retirement gave him time for meditation upon the great change that had come into his life, solitude in which to re-examine, prayerfully and carefully, the whole foundation of his new convictions in the light of Scripture, and the opportunity to settle for all time his faith in Christ and in His gospel.</article>

    <shortdescription>When the Jewish leaders try to capture and kill Saul, he escapes Damascus and goes to Jerusalem. Here the believers are skeptical of his conversion but come to believe him. When his life is again threatened he is sent to Tarsus for a period.</shortdescription>
    <article>Following this apparent time of inaction, Paul once again returned to Damascus (Gal 1:17), from which point the narrative continues in Acts 9. Paul, it would seem, resumed his preaching in the synagogues with the same results as before (v 22). Consequently the Jews laid plans to murder him (vs 23, 24). They were supported in their scheme by the governor of the city, who served under the Nabataean king Aretas (2 Cor 11:32, 33). Since Aretas ruled that area probably between A.D. 37 and c. 54, this event must have occurred somewhere within this period. However, the soldiers, who were watching the gates to prevent Paul’s escape from the city, were frustrated in their design, for some of the local believers lowered Paul in a basket from a window of a house built on the city wall, thus enabling him to evade his enemies (Acts 9:25, 2 Cor 11:33).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
With his opportunity for working in Damascus at an end, Paul turned his eyes toward Jerusalem. Three years had now elapsed since his conversion, but up to this time he had had no contact with any of the church leaders (Gal 1:17, 18), which fact he later offered as proof that his gospel had originated, not with the disciples of Christ, but with Christ Himself (Gal 1:10–12 cf. 1 Cor 15:3–8). His primary reason for going there was to see Peter (Gal 1:18). On arriving in the city he endeavored to join with Peter and the other believers as a Christian brother, but swiftly discovered that 3 years had not sufficed to dim the memory of his previous persecutions, or to remove their fear and suspicion of him (Acts 9:26). The resulting impasse was broken by the Cypriote, Barnabas, who showed his confidence in Paul’s account of his experience by relating it to the others in Paul’s presence (v 27).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Paul demonstrated the genuineness of his experience by preaching Jesus in the city of Jerusalem. His incontrovertible logic aroused the ire of certain Hellenistic Jews, who set about to take his life (Acts 9:29). In a later account of his experience (ch 22:17–21), Paul told how God appeared to him in a vision in the Temple, and over his remonstrances directed him to leave Jerusalem, informing him that the Jews would not receive his message, and that he was to be sent to the Gentiles. His brethren immediately accompanied him to the seaport of Caesarea (ch 9:30), about 53 mi. (c. 85 km.) northwest of Jerusalem. There they probably placed him on board ship to ensure his escape from his enemies.</article>

    <shortdescription>When the church is persecuted after the martyrdom of Stephen, the gospel spreads to Antioch where Barnabas is sent to work. He later takes Saul and works there for a whole year. The church grows. The disciples are first called Christians here.</shortdescription>
    <article>Meanwhile, during Paul’s stay in Cilicia, Christianity had been progressing in other areas. A growing interest had developed at Antioch in Syria, and Barnabas had been dispatched from Jerusalem to foster it (Acts 11:19–24). Deciding that he needed help, he journeyed to Tarsus, found Paul, and brought him back to Antioch with him (vs 25, 26). Paul and Barnabas worked together there for a full year, with noteworthy success.</article>

    <shortdescription>Herod (Agrippa I) persecutes the church. He has John's brother James killed. He then captures Peter and puts him in prison. An angel miraculously frees Peter while the church earnestly prays for his release. Later Agrippa dies a violent death.</shortdescription>
    <article>Had the apostle been guilty of blasphemy or heresy the Sanhedrin would have sentenced him to death by stoning. As in the case of John the Baptist (Matt. 14:10), the decapitation of the apostle James shows that his death was decreed by a civil ruler, who employed Roman methods of punishment (cf. Matt. 20:23). Why Herod should have selected James as his first victim can only be conjectured but as James preached the gospel, he may have continued to occupy the prominent position that he had shared with Peter and John in the gospel story. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
He may have been marked by a natural vehemence, for he was called a son of thunder (Mark 3:17). A tradition, preserved by Eusebius (Ecclesiastical History ii. 9) from Clement of Alexandria, records that James’s accuser became converted when he beheld the faith and patience of his victim. James filled a short ministry of only 13 years after Christ’s ascension. Of the apostles, he died first, whereas John, his brother, was probably the last of the Twelve to die.</article>

    <shortdescription>There were two prominent men named "James" in the early church: the brother of John (the son of Zebedee) and the brother of Jesus (see Gal. 1:19). The first was martyred in A.D. 44. It is more likely the book was written by the latter James.</shortdescription>
    <article>There is no certain method of determining the date of the epistle. As noted above, it seems to have been written when there was only one prominent James in the church, and hence after A.D. 44, when James the son of Zebedee was killed. The internal evidence points to an early date. There is no reference to any large group of Gentile Christians, or to any problems concerning Gentiles. The synagogue is still the church, yet Christianity is widespread (see Acts 2:9–11 4:36 9:2, 10, 14, 19, 26 11:19, 20). The general tenor of the epistle is that Christianity is the culmination of all true Judaism.</article>

    <shortdescription>Prophets come to Antioch from Jerusalem and tell of a coming famine in the world. The disciples decide to send relief to the brethren in Judea and send help through Barnabas and Saul.</shortdescription>
    <article>As they labored in Antioch certain ones having the prophetic gift came from Jerusalem (Acts 11:27). One of these, by the name of Agabus, was divinely inspired to predict a worldwide famine (v 28). As a result of this the believers in Antioch determined to send relief to the Christians of Judea. They chose Paul and Barnabas to take the contribution to Judea (vs 29, 30). Upon the fulfillment of their mission, Paul and Barnabas returned to Antioch, taking with them John Mark, a relative of Barnabas (Acts 12:25 cf. Col 4:10).</article>

    <article>While at Antioch the 2d time, Paul received the call that started him upon his great missionary journeys into Asia Minor and Europe, which earned for him the title of “Apostle to the Gentiles.” As certain ones of the church “ministered to the Lord, and fasted,” they were commanded by the Holy Spirit to set apart Paul and Barnabas for a special work (Acts 13:2). This was done, accompanied by solemn fasting and prayer then, directed by the Holy Spirit, those apostles set out upon the 1st Missionary Journey, accompanied by John Mark (vs 3, 5). First Missionary Journey. Going to Seleucia, which was Antioch’s seaport, some 16 mi. (c. 25.5 km.) from that city, they took ship to the island of Cyprus (Acts 13:4).</article>

    <shortdescription>People from Judea insist that new Gentile believers must be circumcised in order to truly be Christians. A special council is called in Jerusalem in which they decide against this requirement, but do list a few other requirements.</shortdescription>
    <article>Arriving at Jerusalem, Paul and his companions were cordially welcomed by the believers (Acts 15:4). They began to recount how God had blessed the work among the Gentiles, but certain Pharisees, members of the church, soon raised the question of the necessity of circumcision and the keeping of the Mosaic law (v 5). Consequently, a council convened to decide the question (v 6). The matter was debated at length, with Peter, Barnabas, and Paul speaking against pressing the ceremonial law upon the Gentiles (vs 7–12). Their view prevailed, and it was ruled that the Gentile converts should not be expected to be circumcised or to keep the Law of Moses. They were, however, told to abstain from pollutions of idols, fornication, things strangled, and blood (vs 13–21).</article>

Arriving in the area of Derbe and Lystra, Paul found another traveling companion, Timothy, a young man of good reputation, whose mother was Jewish and his father Greek (ch 16:1–3).</article>

    <shortdescription>After leaving Athens, Paul travels to Corinth where he is later joined by Silas and Timothy. He establishes the church in Corinth while working as a tentmaker. He meets Aquila and Priscilla. He writes 1 &amp; 2 Thessalonians.</shortdescription>
    <article>Following his experience at Athens, Paul journeyed westward alone to Corinth (Acts 18:1). There he came in contact with Aquila and his wife, Priscilla, Jews who had recently come from Italy subsequent to a decree by the emperor Claudius banning Jews from Rome (v 2). Since these people, like Paul, were tentmakers, he stayed with them and plied his trade (v 3). Paul most probably arrived in Corinth early in A.D. 51 he remained there more than a year and 6 months (Acts 18:11, 18). At first he labored with the Jews in the synagogue (v 4), as was his usual practice when entering a new city. However, when once again the majority of the Jews opposed and reviled him, he turned from them and began to work more directly for the Gentiles (v 6). No longer able to preach in the synagogue, he held his services in a house owned by a worshiper of God, next door to the synagogue (v 7). The gospel bore much fruit in that city, and among the converts was the ruler of the synagogue (v 8).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Meanwhile Silas and Timothy had arrived with cheering news of the faithfulness of the Thessalonians (Acts 18:5 1 Th 3:6). These tidings inspired Paul, probably in A.D. 51, to write 1 Thessalonians, his first epistle that has been preserved. This was followed—possibly during late 51 or early 52—by 2 Thessalonians. At last, active persecution, that had usually come so quickly in other cities, began to threaten Paul at Corinth also. His Jewish enemies accused him before Gallio, the proconsul of Achaia, of teaching a religion not legally recognized by Rome. However, Gallio drove the accusers away, refusing to become involved in a case that he regarded as a dispute over Jewish, rather than Roman, law. At this the crowd seized the ruler of the synagogue at that time and beat him in the sight of Gallio (Acts 18:12–17).</article>

    <shortdescription>After preaching the gospel to the Thessalonians, Paul, Silas, and Timothy leave the city because of rioting. Later while in Corinth, Paul writes the letter of 1 Thessalonians.</shortdescription>
    <article>The church at Thessalonica, to which 1 Thessalonians was addressed, had been founded by Paul during his Second Missionary Journey A.D. 49-52. Thessalonica, the capital of Macedonia, was governed by seven politarchs under a prefect, and had a population of some 200,000. It is unknown how long Paul stayed there before disturbances incited by the Jews forced him to leave the city and continue his journey. His stay seems to have been rather short, as can be gathered from his desire to return to Thessalonica as soon as possible in order to complete work that he considered as needing his further attention. From Thessalonica Paul went first to Berea and then to Athens, leaving converts behind in each place when he departed. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
From Athens Paul sent Timothy to Thessalonica, since he found himself unable to go (1 Thess. 2:17 to 3:6). By the time Timothy returned with Silas, Paul had moved on to Corinth (Acts 18:5), where Timothy reported to him concerning the spiritual condition of the church at Thessalonica. Paul, realizing that certain misunderstanding concerning his teachings needed immediate attention there, wrote a letter known as 1 Thessalonians. It seems, therefore, that 1 Thessalonians was written shortly after Paul’s arrival in Corinth. According to the tentative chronology of Paul’s ministry accepted in this commentary, this would be in A.D. 51</article>

    <shortdescription>It is likely that 2 Thessalonians, written by Paul while in Corinth, came to this church not more than a few weeks to a few months after the first letter was written. In this letter he assures the believers that Christ has not yet come.</shortdescription>
    <article>This letter cannot have been written much later than the first, because its contents are similar, and the same associates of Paul, Silas and Timothy, are mentioned at the beginning of the letter. This second letter was probably occasioned by the return from Thessalonica of the bearer of the first epistle, from whom Paul learned that his words concerning the imminence of the second advent were being misunderstood and misapplied by certain elements in the church. Therefore Paul gave to this new exposition of his teaching concerning the second coming of Christ a strongly prophetic tone, revealing to his readers that certain great events, especially the reign of Antichrist, would precede Christ’s return. These considerations are the basis for dating the second letter to the Thessalonians not long after the first, either in the last months of A.D. 51 or in the early months of A.D. 52, while Paul was busily engaged in building up the Christian church at Corinth.</article>

    <shortdescription>Paul finishes his second missionary tour and lands in Caesarea. He goes to greet and visit the church in Jerusalem for a short time, but then travels up to Antioch where he spends some time working with the church.</shortdescription>
    <article>After an unspecified period, during which he was apparently able to preach without active opposition, Paul set sail for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila (Acts 18:18). He tarried briefly in Ephesus, and preached in the synagogue. His message was received with favor by his hearers, who were probably both Gentiles and Jews, and he was invited to remain longer. However, he decided to continue his journey, promising to return if possible. He took ship for Caesarea, leaving Priscilla and Aquila at Ephesus, doubtless to carry on the work begun there. Landing at Caesarea  he briefly visited Jerusalem to salute the church, and then went on to Antioch, from which place his missionary journeys had begun (vs 19–22). Thus ended Paul’s 2d Missionary Journey, which had lasted about 3 years, probably from some time in A.D. 49 to possibly late in A.D. 52.</article>

    <shortdescription>Paul begins his third missionary journey from Antioch (as with his first two journeys). He travels through Asia minor, spends three years at Ephesus, goes through Macedonia, and is three months at Corinth before returning to Jerusalem.</shortdescription>
    <article>The length of Paul’s stay at Antioch after his 2d Missionary Journey is not known. It is likely that some months, at least, elapsed before he started from there on his 3d Missionary Journey. He “went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia,” strengthening the churches he had earlier established (Acts 18:23). Having passed through the “upper coasts,” he at length arrived at Ephesus (ch 19:1), which was to be his chief center during this itinerary.</article>

    <shortdescription>The Apostle Paul wrote the book of 1 Corinthians toward the end of a three-year stay in Ephesus, probably in the spring. Some date the writing to A.D. 56 based on Paul's trial before Gallio in Corinth.</shortdescription>
    <article>First Corinthians was written from Ephesus (1 Cor. 16:8). This city was the scene of Paul’s labors for “three years” (Acts 20:31) and the chief center of his activities during his Third Missionary Journey (Acts 19 20:1). He was about to depart for Greece and Macedonia when the letter was written, but hoped to remain at Ephesus “until Pentecost” (1 Cor. 16:5–8). However, circumstances hastened his departure (Acts 19:21 to 20:3). These observations enable us to date the letter in the spring of A.D. 56.</article>

    <shortdescription>Paul wrote the book of 2 Corinthians from Macedonia within a year of writing the book of 1 Corinthians as can be seen within the letter itself (2 Cor. 7:5). False teachers made Paul's second visit to Corinth challenging. His letter addresses this.</shortdescription>
    <article>Paul made at least three visits, and wrote three, perhaps four, epistles to the church at Corinth. The first visit, about A.D. 51, during the course of his Second Missionary Journey, continued for a year and a half (Acts 18:11). At this time Paul founded and organized the church. He continued to keep in touch with it from time to time through representatives (2 Cor. 12:17). His first written contact with it is mentioned in 1 Cor. 5:9. This document is now presumed lost. Toward the close of more than two years spent at Ephesus, on the third journey, he wrote what is now known as First Corinthians (ch. 16:8).</article>

    <shortdescription>After being arrested in Jerusalem, Paul is sent to Caesarea where he is imprisoned for two years. During this time he is brought before Felix who was later replaced by Porcius Festus. He appeals to Caesar and is sent to Rome.</shortdescription>
    <article>At Caesarea Paul was turned over to Felix, the governor of Judea, with a letter from Lysias. Felix questioned Paul and then directed that he be confined to the *praetorium until his Jewish accusers should arrive from Jerusalem (Acts 23:25–35). After 5 days Ananias, the high priest, accompanied by certain elders, and Tertullus, a professional orator, appeared and accused Paul of sedition and of profanation of the Temple (ch 24:1–9). After the accused had spoken in his own defense, Felix delayed making a decision until further evidence was available. In the meantime Paul was granted a large measure of freedom (vs 10–23). Some time later he was again brought before Felix and his Jewish wife, Drusilla. Apparently this hearing was not in the nature of a trial, but merely a pretext to hear what Paul had to say. On this occasion Paul “reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come,” with the result that Felix’ conscience was greatly, but evidently only temporarily, disturbed (vs 24, 25). Following this event, Paul was kept a prisoner for 2 years, until Felix was replaced by Porcius Festus (vs 26, 27). This was about A.D. 60.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Almost as soon as Festus took office the Jews requested that he send Paul to Jerusalem for trial, intending to assassinate him on the way from Caesarea. Festus refused, but invited them to make their charges against the apostle at Caesarea. This they did, making many unproved charges. Festus inquired whether Paul would be willing to stand trial in Jerusalem. Doubtless considering that an order to renew the trial in Jerusalem would be the equivalent to his death sentence, Paul decided to invoke his rights as a Roman citizen, and appealed to Caesar (Nero see Caesar, 4). The appeal was accepted, and Paul awaited transportation to Rome, safely out of reach of his angry countrymen (Acts 25:1–12).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Shortly after this Herod Agripppa II, king of territories north and east of Judea, came with his sister *Bernice to pay a courtesy visit to Festus, the new governor of Judea. Festus related to them the story of Paul whereupon Agrippa requested to hear the apostle for himself. The following day Paul was brought before the rulers (Acts 25:13–27), and was given permission to speak. He described his background, his conversion to Christianity, and his experiences of persecution from the Jews. When he told of Jesus and His resurrection from the dead, the pagan Festus declared the apostle to be mad. Nevertheless Paul strongly appealed to the king’s convictions, but with no apparent success. Following Paul’s defense the rulers decided that the prisoner might have been liberated had he not already appealed to Caesar (Acts 26:1–32).</article>

    <shortdescription>Paul, accused by Jewish leaders, makes an appeal to Caesar and is taken by ship to Rome. Along the way they are shipwrecked in Malta. Three months later they sailed to Rome.</shortdescription>
    <article>The decision being made to send Paul to Rome (probably in the spring of A.D. 60), he, with other prisoners scheduled for the same journey, was placed in the custody of a centurion named Julius, who was charged with taking them to the capital (Acts 27:1). During this trip Paul had at least 2 Christian companions, Aristarchus (v 2), and Luke, the writer of Acts, as is shown by Luke’s frequent use of “we” in the narrative. Soon after departure the vessel stopped at Sidon. There Paul, who was well treated by the centurion, was permitted to visit the believers. From Sidon  the ship sailed between the island of Cyprus and the mainland and finally reached Myra in Lycia (vs 3–5), where the whole company boarded another ship bound for Italy (v 6). This ship then had 276 people aboard (v 37). At length the ship reached the island of Crete (B-3/4) and with difficulty sailed to a place called Fair Havens (vs 7, 8). There they spent some time, debating whether, because of the lateness of the season, the voyage should be continued. Paul counseled against doing so, but the shipowner and the captain spoke in favor of it, and the centurion was influenced by the latter. Because Fair Havens was not suitable to winter in, they decided to try to reach Phoenix (Phenice), farther along the coast of Crete (vs 9–12). Consequently, as soon as a suitable wind arose they left Fair Havens and headed toward Phoenix.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Shortly afterward, however, a great tempest arose, blowing from the east or east-northeast, which drove the ship before it. When they found temporary shelter under the lee of a small island named Cauda (Clauda), they succeeded in hoisting aboard the ship’s boat, which had heretofore been towed. On the following day, since the storm continued unabated, it was deemed necessary to lighten the ship by jettisoning some of the cargo (cf. v 38). The tempest persisted for several days until all hope was abandoned (Acts 27:20). At about this time Paul was given a vision, in which he was shown that no lives would be lost and that he would have the opportunity of standing before Caesar. He related this experience to his companions, exhorting them to be of good courage (vs 21–26). At last, one night, 2 weeks after the storm struck, the sailors suspected that they were nearing land. Dawn revealed unfamiliar land with a bay. Into this they decided to try to run the ship. They raised the anchors and endeavored to steer into the bay. Drawing close to land, they were caught by violent crosscurrents, which hurled the ship upon the rocks, where it grounded. The stern was then broken off by the pounding waves. The soldiers, obviously considering that they were responsible for the prisoners with their own lives, now urged that the prisoners be killed lest they escape. However, the centurion, wanting to save Paul, forbade this. Instead he commanded all to attempt to get ashore as best they could, and all on board reached land safely (vs 39–44). The land proved to be the island of Malta. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The people of Malta  treated the castaway group hospitably, and endeavored to care for their needs. Finally, after spending 3 months on the island (v 11), the shipwrecked company sailed for Rome, probably in the spring of A.D. 61 on an Alexandrian ship that had wintered there (vs 8–11).</article>

    <shortdescription>Paul wrote the letters of Ephesians, Colossians, and Philemon while a prisoner in Rome. He makes reference in Philippians 2:24 (and Philemon 22) of his "soon release." Ephesians and Colossians have strong similarities in content and style.</shortdescription>
    <article>From the earliest times Rome has been considered as the place from which the prison epistles were dispatched. They usually have been dated in the latter part of the apostle’s imprisonment there, since in them he expresses a hope of being released, for which he must have had some reason (Phil. 2:24 Philemon 22). His imprisonment in Rome lasted two years (Acts 28:30), from the spring of a.d. 60 to 62, according to the chronology of Paul’s ministry. Therefore Ephesians, Colossians, and Philemon can be dated about a.d. 62.</article>

    <shortdescription>After arriving at Rome as a prisoner, Paul is given some freedom and meets with Jewish leaders to share the gospel. The book of Acts ends on a positive note that Paul was able to spread the gospel, from the very center of civilization in Rome.</shortdescription>
    <article>Upon his arrival at Rome, Paul, with the other prisoners, was delivered to “the captain of the guard” (Acts 28:16, KJV), probably the chief of the Praetorian Guard (the imperial guard stationed at Rome) in charge of prisoners who appealed to the emperor. At this time the office was held by Burrus, a man of good principles, one whose restraining influence had helped to curb the emperor Nero’s excesses. Paul, presumably on the recommendation of the centurion who had escorted him from Caesarea, was permitted to stay in his own living quarters, being guarded, however, by a soldier (v 16), to whom he was chained (see Acts 28:20 cf. Eph 6:20 Col 4:18). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Three days after his arrival in Rome, Paul invited the Jewish elders to visit him. After he had explained to them the reason for his imprisonment they agreed on a time for Paul to expound to them the Christian doctrines. On the appointed day many came to his lodging to hear him as he “testified the kingdom of God.” This meeting lasted all day, during which the truths that Paul preached were doubtlessly debated back and forth. At the end of the meeting some believed and some, probably the majority, did not “they agreed not among themselves.” At this Paul quoted from Is 6:9, 10, reproving the unbelieving for refusing to accept the light that had come to them (Acts 28:17–28). The book of Acts and the Bible account of the apostle’s life is rather abruptly ended at this point with the statement that Paul, clearly still a prisoner, was nevertheless able to live for 2 years in his own rented lodging , obviously under guard, and had visitors to whom he preached Christ (vs 30, 31).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
For the rest of the story of Paul’s life we must depend upon scant clues found in his various epistles written during and after his 1st imprisonment in Rome, upon statements contained in other early writings, and upon tradition. The epistles of Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon were written during this 1st period in Rome. These epistles reveal that the imprisonment was a trying experience for the aged apostle (Eph 3:1 6:20 Col 4:18 Phm 1, 9, 10). From Acts 27:2 and Eph 6:21 we know that Luke, Aristarchus, and Tychicus were his companions. He also had with him Mark, Justus, Epaphras, and Demas, possibly for only part time (Col 4:10–12, 14 cf. 2 Ti 4:10) Epaphroditus delivered Paul’s epistles to the Philippians (Php 2:25–30). Tychicus carried the letter to the Ephesians (Eph 6:21, 22) and, accompanied by Onesimus, the letter to the Colossians (Col 4:7–9), and the one to the Christian slaveowner, Philemon. Onesimus, Philemon’s slave who had escaped to Rome, seems to have been converted by Paul at Rome (Col 4:9 Phm 10). From Php 4:18 we learn that the Philippians sent gifts to Paul delivered by Epaphroditus.</article>

    <shortdescription>Paul probably wrote the book of Philippians from prison. Scholars debate whether it was from Rome or from Caesarea. The letter is one of the most upbeat of all his writings, giving the impression he would soon be released from prison.</shortdescription>
    <article>The letter to the Philippians is probably the last of the prison epistles. It implies that Paul had been in Rome some time, and already had seen considerable fruitage from his labors (see on Phil. 1:12–14). Furthermore, the whole atmosphere of the letter is one of happiness. Apparently Paul expected a favorable outcome of his appeal to Caesar (Acts 25:10–12), which would allow him once more to visit his beloved church in Philippi (Phil. 2:24). At the same time his words leave no doubt in the mind of his readers that an unfavorable decision would not have found him unprepared (Phil. 1:19, 20, 22–25). It may therefore be concluded that Philippians was probably written in a.d. 62.</article>

    <shortdescription>Scholars have long debated both the authorship and date for the book of Hebrews. The letter itself does not clearly state who wrote this book, but he clearly knew the Greek language well and was very familiar with the Old Testament sanctuary.</shortdescription>
    <article>It is generally agreed that Hebrews was written before the fall of Jerusalem. Now, the number of church leaders was very small in the years before A.D. 70. Which of those leaders might have set forth an argument as profound as that presented in the book of Hebrews? By all odds the most likely person is Paul. To say that the author was an unknown Christian of that early period simply poses a new problem. How was it that a Christian possessing the theological insights and the logical powers necessary to produce a work like Hebrews should have been anonymous at a time when Christian leaders were so few and the record of Christian workers so full?</article>

    <shortdescription>After being imprisoned for 2 years, Paul is released and conducts missionary travels. References in 1 Timothy and Titus indicate the freedom he has during this time in Crete, Asia Minor, and Macedonia. He is eventually arrested a second time.</shortdescription>
    <article>At the end of 2 years (probably A.D. 63), Paul was tried at the judgment seat of Nero and released. The epistles written during this period of freedom, 1 Timothy and Titus, show that the apostle once more conducted missionary travels after his release. Clement of Rome (The First Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians 5) says that Paul preached in both East and West. Since the apostle had planned to go to Spain (Rom 15:24, 28), it is possible that he now visited that country. The Muratorian Fragment (c. A.D. 190) states that he did visit Spain. Paul probably also carried out his expressed purpose of visiting Philippi (Php 2:24) and Colossae (Phm 22 cf. Col 4:9 Phm 10). From 1 Ti 1:3 we can conclude that he went to Macedonia and Ephesus. He also apparently visited Crete (Tit 1:5), and possibly Corinth (2 Ti 4:20). He also may have spent a winter (perhaps A.D. 65) at Nicopolis (Tit 3:12), on the western coast of Greece.</article>

    <shortdescription>The book of 1 Peter indicates that Peter was the author of this letter (1:1). It was probably written from Rome ("Babylon," 5:13) in the first half of the 60s. Peter, according to tradition, died as a martyr in Rome after Nero's great persecution.</shortdescription>
    <article>The precise date of the writing of this epistle cannot be determined. The letter was written probably from Rome, as the name “Babylon” suggests (see 5:13). This would mean that it was written near the end of the apostle’s life. The absence of any reference to Peter’s presence in Rome in Paul’s letters from that city suggests that Peter did not arrive there until about the time of Paul’s final arrest, about a.d. 66. Although nothing definite can be said regarding the date of 1 Peter, the foregoing suggests as a likely date the middle of the sixties of the 1st century. The epistle reflects the existence of an unfriendly attitude toward Christians (2:12 4:12–16). This may suggest the time of Nero’s persecution, which began in a.d. 64.</article>

    <shortdescription>It is difficult to determine the date of Jude. It appears that this letter and that of 2 Peter are related. If Peter used ideas from Jude to write, then the date of Jude would be before a.d. 65. Jude may have been a stepbrother of Jesus.</shortdescription>
    <article>An interesting question is raised by the fact that much of Jude’s material is found also in 2 Peter (cf. Jude 4–18 with 2 Peter 2:1 to 3:3). Not only the same thoughts, but in many instances the same words are used, with some words quite unusual. Did Jude borrow from 2 Peter, Peter from Jude, or did they both borrow from a common but unknown source? This question cannot be answered with finality. Most Biblical scholars think that Jude is the earlier of the two letters, since it would be difficult to explain why Jude would write a letter at all if he had little to say beyond what was already well expressed in 2 Peter. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
These scholars assert that it is easy to explain how Peter might have used thoughts expressed in Jude’s brief epistle, and then have added material to it. Literally studies show that the shorter of two similar works is usually the earlier. However, a minority of scholars defends the priority of 2 Peter over that of Jude. Among the reasons set forth are the following: (1) 2 Peter 2:1 speaks of the future appearance of false teachers whereas Jude gives the impression that these teachers are already at work (Jude 4). (2) Jude speaks of the warning about the coming of skeptics as being in the past (vs. 17, 18), whereas Peter utters a current warning (2 Peter 3:3).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The arguments on either side are not sufficiently decisive to determine which of the two epistles, Jude or 2 Peter, was the earlier. For this reason it is impossible to date Jude’s letter. If written before 2 Peter it must have been composed before A.D. 67, the probable year of Peter’s death if Jude followed 2 Peter, it may have been written between the years A.D. 70 and 85.</article>

    <shortdescription>The book of 1 Timothy was written by Paul, probably after his release from prison in Rome. After visiting Ephesus, he went to Macedonia where he penned this letter of instruction to his young associate in ministry, Timothy.</shortdescription>
    <article>Since Paul had indicated in his prison epistles that he was anxious to see the churches in Asia and Macedonia as soon as possible (Phil. 2:24 Philemon 22), it may be assumed that he traveled to those eastern lands shortly after his release. He visited Ephesus, the main city of the province of Asia, before he proceeded to Macedonia (1 Tim. 1:3), where the beloved church of Philippi was located. The first letter to Timothy was written after these visits, and so may be dated about a year following his release, probably a.d. 65.</article>

    <shortdescription>Paul wrote the book of Titus probably after his first release from prison in Rome. It was written to his co-hort in ministry, Titus, who worked on the island of Crete. Paul indicates he wrote from Nicopolis.</shortdescription>
    <article>The letter to Titus seems to have been written somewhat later than 1 Timothy, although it deals with matter very similar to that discussed in the first letter to Timothy. It refers to Paul’s work on the island of Crete, which must have taken place also during this last missionary journey (Titus 1:5). However, when the letter was written, Paul had already left the island and had probably gone to Greece, leaving Titus in charge of the work on Crete. Informing Titus of his plans to spend the coming winter at Nicopolis on the western coast of Greece, he requested his young fellow worker to meet him there (3:12). If a year is allowed for Paul’s journey in Asia Minor and Macedonia, and some time for his work in Crete and Greece, his letter to Titus may be dated about a.d. 65.</article>

    <shortdescription>Peter wrote the book of 2 Peter. According to the letter (1:13-14) he expected to die soon. Tradition is that he died under the hand of Nero, which would place this book around a.d. 65. It was probably written from Rome.</shortdescription>
    <article>Second Peter is addressed to “them that have obtained like precious faith with us” ch.ch. chapter 1:1, presumably referring to the readers of the first epistle see p.p. page 547. This appears to be confirmed by ch. 3:1. Peter must have been martyred no later than a.d. 65. His second epistle is thought to have been written shortly before this date. There is no evidence to determine where the epistle was written, most probably it was Rome.</article>

    <shortdescription>Paul wrote 2 Timothy during his final imprisonment in Rome, probably in the autumn of a.d. 66. It is clearly a difficult time for Paul. He seems to have had one hearing and was awaiting another.</shortdescription>
    <article>After his arrest, probably in a.d. 66, Paul was once more transported to Rome. At the time he wrote his second letter to Timothy, he seems already to have had one hearing but not yet to have been sentenced 2 Tim. 4:17. Although he apparently had little hope of a favorable verdict v.v. verse 6, he seems to have thought that he might spend at least the following winter in Rome (v. 21), possibly because he knew by experience how slowly Roman courts worked. If this expectation proved to be true, and Paul died in a.d. 67, the second letter to Timothy may be dated in the autumn of a.d. 66.</article>

    <shortdescription>The Bible does not clearly give an account of the death of Paul, though his letters show death is imminent (2 Timothy 4:7, 8). Tradition states Paul was beheaded.</shortdescription>
    <article>Early Christian authors are unanimous in declaring that Paul died under Nero at Rome. His execution, then, which tradition says was by decapitation somewhere on the Ostian Way, must have taken place at least by A.D. 68, for Nero himself died that year. He was executed probably sometime between A.D. 66 and 68. &lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>God is aware of every injustice committed against His people. Revelation 8 and 9 present seven trumpets blown by seven angels who announce judgments that fall on those who have attacked the children of the Lord (see 6:10).</shortdescription>
    <article>God is aware of every injustice committed against His people. Revelation 8 and 9 present seven trumpets blown by seven angels who announce judgments that fall on those who have attacked the children of the Lord (see 6:10). Trumpets are used in the Bible for worship, battle, and celebration. The language of the sanctuary opens this section of Revelation showing that the incense (prayers of the saints) rises up to God and judgment follows. The Lord responds when trumpets are blown. The sequence of trumpets not only depicts a span of history from the cross to Jesus’ second coming, but also a preliminary judgment coming upon the wicked just before Christ comes. The trumpets and judgments are filled with symbols that show God hears the cries of His people.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
·         The First Trumpet: When the first angel blows a trumpet (Revelation 8:7) there is hail, fire, and blood thrown to the earth. It burns up a third of all vegetation. Some see this trumpet portraying judgments which fell on Jerusalem in the 1st century (see Luke 21:20-24). It is important to remember these judgments do not fall on “the saints” (8:5 and 9:4).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
·         The Second Trumpet: The first judgment destroys one third of all vegetation. The second judgment strikes one third of the ocean (8:8, 9). Animals and ships are destroyed. Some see this judgment as depicting the fall of Rome in the fifth century A.D. which would have been, for the first readers of Revelation, a dream come true. God will act on behalf of His people at the proper time.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
·         The Third Trumpet: In the third judgment one third of all fresh water is struck and becomes so bitter it destroys people (8:10, 11). If pure water represents the truth of Christ, then bitter water speaks of idolatry and false teachings, which became prominent during the apostasy of the church in the Middle Ages. It may also portray the invasion and ravages of the Huns in the 5th century. In the first four trumpets there is a pattern of “one third” which shows these are not the complete or final judgments.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
·         The Fourth Trumpet: The impact on nature continues to symbolize the judgments on the wicked that harm God’s people. In the fourth trumpet the heavens are struck with one third darkness. Certainly spiritual darkness came during the Middle Ages and the Enlightenment when doubts about God and Scripture were raised. This could also describe the extinction of the Roman government.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
·         The Fifth Trumpet: The next three trumpets are introduced with the words, “Woe, woe, woe …” (8:13) indicating an intensity in judgments. The fifth trumpet is filled with evil imagery of a bottomless pit, smoke, locusts, and scorpions. The demonic language shows Satan’s increasing focus to delude people. It describes the growing secularism and skepticism of the 19th century. This was when doubts about creation were proposed. Some also see this trumpet applying to the ascending power of the Saracens.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
·         The Sixth Trumpet: Similar to the fifth trumpet but growing in intensity, this judgment uses military imagery which leads up to the battle of Armageddon. It represents opposition to God’s children at the end of time. It has also been applied to the Middle East and the Turkish Empire. Using the day for a year principle, time frames have been applied to the Ottoman’s tormenting the Byzantine Empire. What is clear is that Satan wants to destroy God’s people, but the Lord protects them.&lt;BR /&gt;
There is an interlude between the sixth and seventh trumpets in which John, in chapters 10 and 11, describes the experiences of God’s people just before the close of probation. Satan has been gathering and preparing his army for battle, so God is preparing a people to stand against the devil’s threats.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
·         The Seventh Trumpet: The seventh trumpet marks the beginning of the end of probation for people on the earth (10:7), yet more events must happen before Christ’s return. The last trumpet describes the third “Woe” (11:14). We read, “The nations were angry …” (11:18). The Lord is also angry at injustice. His response is the righteous “wrath of God” when further judgments are poured out in the seven last plagues (Ch. 16). Reference to the heavenly sanctuary (11:19) points to the end of the 2,300 day prophecy which took place in 1844 A.D.</article>

    <shortdescription>The synoptic gospels each describe the fall of Jerusalem in the same passage as the signs of Christ's return.</shortdescription>
    <article>In the year 70A.D., the First Jewish-Roman War culminated with the Siege of Jerusalem. The siege was executed by Titus, who would later become emperor, and Tiberius Julius Alexander. The Jewish defenders had occupied Jerusalem since 66. The city and its famous Second Temple were both destroyed during the Roman invasion following the siege. These events are memorialized both by the annual Jewish fast Tisha B'Av, and the Arch of Titus, which still stands in Rome.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <article>It appears that it is impossible from internal evidence to come to any firm conclusion as to the relative dating of the two works. It is clear, however, that the epistle was written by an elderly man who could rightly address his converts as “little children” chs.chs. chapters 2:1, 12, 18, 28 3:7, 18 4:4 5:21. The destination of the letter is not stated, but it is obviously addressed to a known group of Christians with whom the revered author was personally acquainted. No conclusive reason has yet been advanced for rejecting the widely held tradition that it was written by John in his old age to believers Ephesus, or at least in Asia Minor, where he had ministered. The date of writing is probably during the first half of the nineties of the 1st century a.d.</article>

    <shortdescription>The style of 2 John (as with 1 John) points to John, the disciple of Jesus, as the author. The date of writing is probably in the early 90s and fits with John's description of himself ("the elder"). It was written to warn about false teachers.</shortdescription>
    <article>It seems probable that this letter was written after the first epistle, and, if John be accepted as the author, soon after the first letter, in view of the apostle’s age. The additional factor brought to light by the second epistle is that false teachers were taking advantage of Christian hospitality to disseminate erroneous doctrine.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Because of the many similarities with 1 and 2 John, we know this is the third in a trio of letters. It was written in the last part of John's life to a specific person named Gaius. </shortdescription>
    <article>Several things point to a development of the situation revealed in the second epistle of John, and makes the third the last in the trio of letter preserved to us. This is not to say that John wrote no other letters. There is no evidence to prove that the letter referred to in v.v. verse 9 was the second epistle, although it is an attractive possibility and there is no way of determining the length of time that passed between the writing of the second epistle and that of the third, but it seems probable that the interval was brief, since the letters are so closely related in style and content.</article>

    <shortdescription>Many early church Christian writers point to John, the disciple of Jesus, as the writer of the book of Revelation. He wrote of visions given to him of things to come while a prisoner exiled on the Isle of Patmos during the time of Domitian's reign.</shortdescription>
    <article>The testimony of early Christian writers is almost unanimous that the book of Revelation was written during the reign of Domitian. Irenaeus, who claims to have had a personal connection with John through Polycarp, declares of the Revelation, “For that was seen no very long time since, but almost in our day, towards the end of Domitian’s reign” (op. cit. v. 30. 3 ANF, vol. 1, pp. 559, 560). Victorinus (died c. A.D. 303) says, “When John said these things he was in the island of Patmos, condemned to the labour of the mines by Caesar Domitian. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
There, therefore, he saw the Apocalypse” (Commentary on the Apocalypse, on ch. 10:11 ANF, vol. 7, p. 353 see on Rev. 1:9). Eusebius (op. cit. iii. 20. 8, 9) records that John was sent to Patmos by Domitian, and that when those who had been unjustly banished by Domitian were released by his successor, Nerva (A.D. 96–98 see Vol. VI, p. 87), the apostle returned to Ephesus. Such early Christian testimony leads the authors of this commentary to place the writing of the Revelation during the time of Domitian’s reign, which ended in A.D. 96.</article>

    <shortdescription>The message to the church of Smyrna is to a persecuted church and represents a time of persecution in the church (2nd and 3rd centuries). Smyrna was also a seaport city. This church received no correction, but was encouraged to be faithful to death.</shortdescription>
    <article>Smyrna was the second of the seven churches listed in the book of Revelation that received a special message from Christ. Though it was an ancient city located about 50 miles north of Ephesus in Asia Minor that suffered persecution, it is also a church which represents a period of history during which God’s people suffered much bloodshed. The letter to the church of Smyrna is a letter to all Christians suffering for their faith. Unlike most of the other letters to the churches, this church does not receive a rebuke.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Tribulation in Smyrna&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
The name “Smyrna” is possibly derived from the word “myrrh”. This old city at one time produced an aromatic gum used in embalming the dead. Others believe the name comes from an ancient goddess named Samorna. The purpose of the letter to Smyrna is to provide hope and courage to a church whose members were dying for their belief in Jesus. The letter begins with reference to Jesus Christ as the “First and the Last, who was dead, and came to life” (Revelation 2:8). These are meaningful words to a church whose members were giving up their lives for Christ. Jesus says He knows of their “tribulation.” &lt;BR /&gt;
The period of church history represented by Smyrna stretches from the end of the first century (about A.D. 100) to the time when Constantine spoke favorably about Christians (about A.D. 313). This 200 year slice of time is marked by major bloodshed among Christians. Roman rulers such as Trajan, Hadrian, and Marcus Aurelius began persecutions which became more systematic under Decius and Valerian. The worst oppression happened under Diocletian (284-305). Smyrna rightfully represents the “Age of Martyrdom” in Christian church history.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The letter suggests that some “who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan” may indicate some Jews (or people who figuratively called themselves Jews) were reporting Christians to the authorities. From the book of Acts we know there were Jews who maligned Christians. Smyrna held a large Jewish population during the time of John. The word Satan means “accuser” and plots against Christians could have been made in the Jewish synagogues. But Jesus says, “Do not fear any of those things which you are about to suffer. Indeed, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested…” (v. 10). From Trajan to Constantine, the arrest and imprisonment of Christians grew more and more extensive. Historical records outline procedures in Roman government for executing followers of Christ.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Ten Days&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
An interesting reference in this letter says, “…you will have tribulation ten days” (v. 10). This has been taken to mean by some as a “general period of time.” But many Bible students have applied the “day for a year” principle of prophetic interpretation (see Daniel 7:25) to mean 10 years. That application certainly fits the most severe time of persecution for Christians begun under Diocletian from A.D. 303-313. During this period an effort was made to completely wipe out Christians. The Scriptures were gathered and burned and a special focus was made to capture and destroy the clergy. Jesus said in the letter to Smyrna, “Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life” (v. 10). The word “crown” speaks of the garland of victory given to winners in the Greek games. Though some would be put to death, Christ assures all who are victors in faith that they will receive the crown of eternal life.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;No Second Death&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
As with the letter to Ephesus, this letter also concludes with “He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes shall not be hurt by the second death” (v. 11). The “first death” is a temporary ending of life. The “second death” speaks of an eternal death from which no one will be resurrected (see Acts 24:15 and Revelation 20:14).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
If you have experienced trials because of your faith in Jesus, you may find hope in the message to the church of Smyrna. Christ knows about your tribulations. The Lord is aware of the challenges you face and assures you that even in the face of death you may have the assurance of eternal life. Be faithful! The One who is the First and Last, who was dead and is alive, holds you in His hands. Jesus will not allow you to be hurt by the second death.</article>

    <article>Roman Emperor Constantine I, also known as Constantine the Great or Saint Constantine, ruled from 306 until 337A.D. He lived from c. 27 February 272 until 22 May 337. Constantine was the first Roman Emperor to convert to Christianity, and together with his co-emperor Licinius he issued the Edict of Milan in 313. This edict declared religious tolerance throughout the empire.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>One of the worst persecutions in history was foretold prophetically in Revelation. The edict was officially rescinded in 311AD.</shortdescription>
    <article>The Roman Emperor Diocletian ordered that the Christian church in Nicodemia be destroyed on 23 February 303A.D. The following day, he published his first "Edict Against the Christians." This edict legalized the destruction of Scriptures held by Christians and Christian places of worship throughout the Empire and forbid Christian worship assemblies. Before the end of the month, a fire destroyed a portion of the imperial palace. Diocletian was convinced that Christians were responsible, having conspired with the palace eunuchs. Despite an investigation that revealed no responsible parties, many were executed for the crime nonetheless, including the palace eunuchs Dorotheus and Gorgonius. Torture often accompanied the execution, as was the case with Peter Cubicularius, who was stripped, raised high, and scourged. Salt and vinegar were subsequently poured into his wounds, and he was slowly boiled over a flame. These executions continued until at least 24 April of that year.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Further persecutionary edicts followed over the next decade, with varying levels of success. These edicts mandated the arrest of clergy and universal sacrifices of Christians, among other things, but many Christians escaped persecution or were maimed but survived. The pagan Romans were generally unsympathetic to the persecutions. The early Christian church was greatly strengthened by the sufferings of its martyrs. Constantine did not apply the later edicts to Christians in the West, who were left unharmed. The edict was rescinded in 311 by Galerius, and Constantine declared a formal edict of toleration in 313.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>The letter to the church of Pergamos warns against compromise and depicts a time following Diocletian's persecutions when the Roman empire became "Christianized" and the papacy rose as a political power.</shortdescription>
    <article>The third letter to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 is to the church in Pergamos (or Pergamum). Its message is directed to a compromising church. Pergamos had been the capital of the Roman province of Asia for 200 years and was a center of intellectual and cultural life in the Greek world. Christ affirms those in this church who hold fast to His name, but rebukes others who hold to false doctrines. Unlike the church of Ephesus (strong in doctrine and weak in love), the church of Pergamos is weak in doctrine. This church represents a period of compromise in history (313 – 538 A.D.) when Christianity became generally accepted and pagan doctrines crept into the teachings of the church.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;The Impressive City&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
None of the other cities of the seven churches can compare with Pergamos. It was located about 50 miles north of Smyrna. Though Ephesus was growing and competing with Pergamos as a leading center in Asia Minor, archaeologists have revealed incredible structures of this old city. The most famous is the Pergamon Altar (Great Altar of Zeus). This temple has been reconstructed and is viewed as one of the pinnacles of Hellenistic culture. It must have been an attraction for the Christians living there. Walking among impressive human achievements can lead to compromising divine truths.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Christ is introduced in the letter to Pergamos as the One “who has the sharp two-edged sword” (Revelation 2:12). Truth must cut deep to reveal compromise. Jesus says this church dwells close to “Satan’s throne”, probably referring to emperor worship introduced in pagan temples of the Roman Empire.  The pagan environment was slowly blending in with Christianity and eroding truth. This was the “Age of Popularity”. It was also the time when the Roman papacy’s influence grew in power in Western Europe. The period of church history represented by Pergamos is from the time of Constantine (about 313 A.D.) to 538 A.D.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Pergamos is rebuked for holding “the doctrine of Balaam” (v. 14). Two stumbling blocks in ancient Israel (see Numbers 22-25) find themselves in this church: idolatry and sexual immorality. Not only were these practiced in temple cult worship, but they represent a spiritual compromise in worship to God. Fornication symbolizes God’s pure church being unfaithful in keeping pure doctrine. Christ calls this church to repent. Nothing less than a complete turn-around is needed for a church that has allowed false teachings to come in. Unless people repent, Christ will “fight against them with the sword” of His mouth (v. 16), which is the truth or the Word of God.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Promises to Overcomers&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
For those who overcome in Pergamos, Jesus promises some of the “hidden manna” to eat. This may refer to the manna that Aaron placed in a jar before the Ark of the Covenant in the wilderness sanctuary. A deeper application probably points to Jesus Himself who is the bread of life. Christ also says, “I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written which no one knows except him who receives it” (v. 17). Many believe this white stone refers to an ancient custom of jurors giving either a black stone or white stone to convict or acquit people on trial. The “new name” probably teaches that just as our Bible names indicate a person’s character, a new name would indicate the new characters Christians receive as they remain faithful to truth.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Many Christians today live in places of compromise. People close to the world may become enamored by the impressive structures of man (secular or religious) and find it too easy to say, “It doesn’t matter.” Truth matters to God. The church that becomes lax in teaching clear truth will allow compromise to creep into its doctrine and practice. Members who want to be accepted by the community at the expense of their faith are committing spiritual adultery. Jesus has a one-word sermon for such churches, “Repent!” We must turn around and abandon all beliefs that mix truth and error. Only those who repent will eat the true Manna from heaven, Jesus Christ. Only those who remain faithful to God’s word will receive new characters that will last much longer than the ruins of a once-famous city called Pergamos.</article>

    <shortdescription>Constantine and his co-emperor legalized Christianity across Rome in 313AD.</shortdescription>
    <article>Roman co-emperors Constantine and Licinius met in Milan in 313A.D. to secure their alliance through Licinius' marriage to Constantia, Constantine's half-sister. It was here that the men crafted the Edict of Milan, sometimes referred to as the Edict of Toleration. This edict granted tolerance to all religions in the Empire, including Christianity, which had been heavily persecuted for the previous decade. The Christian religion was given legal recognition for the first time, and Christians were granted full restoration for the property seized during the persecutions. The edict uses the Latin phrase summa divintas, a general term referring to divinity, rather than specific religious names or terms.</article>

    <shortdescription>The legs of iron, in Nebuchadnezzar's great dream of an image, represents Rome, but the feet are made of iron mixed with clay. The nation of Rome was divided and Western Europe became a mixture of strong and weak countries.</shortdescription>
    <article>In the great dream of Daniel 2 the statute's feet are described. Though mentioning the toes, Daniel does not specifically call attention to their number. He does mention that the kingdom was to be divided. Many commentators have held that the toes, of which there were presumably 10, correspond to the 10 horns of the fourth beast of ch. 7 (see on ch. 7:7). Miry clay. See on v. 33. Rome had lost its iron tenacity and strength, and its successors were manifestly weak, like the admixture of clay with the iron. Partly strong. These barbarian kingdoms differed greatly in military prowess, as Gibbon states when he refers to “the powerful monarchies of the Franks and the Visigoths, and the dependent kingdoms of the Sueves and Burgundians.”&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Broken. Literally, “fragile,” “brittle.”&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Verse 43 speaks of the "seed of men." Many commentators refer this to royal intermarriages, though the intent of the statement may be wider. The word for man is ’enash, “mankind.” “Seed” means descendants. Hence there may also be a general indication of a shifting back and forth of populations, but with nationalism continuing strong. The original LXX version has several variations from the Masoretic text, vs. 42, 43 reading: “And the toes of the feet a certain part of iron and a certain part of earthenware, a certain part of the kingdom shall be strong and a certain part shall be broken. And as you saw the iron mixed with earthenware, there shall be mixings among nations [or, among generations] of men, but they shall not agree [literally, “be like-minded”], nor be friendly with one another even as it is impossible to mix iron with clay.” &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Shall not cleave. Daniel’s prophecy has stood and will stand the test of time. Some world powers have been weak, others strong. Nationalism has continued strong. Attempts to unite into one great empire the various nations that grew out of the fourth empire have ended in failure. Temporarily certain sections have been united, but the union has not proved peaceful or permanent. There have also been many political alliances among the nations. Farseeing statesmen have tried in various ways to bring about a federation of nations that would operate successfully, but all such attempts have proved disappointing.</article>

    <shortdescription>The fourth beast in Daniel's dream represents Rome. Ten horns symbolize ten kingdoms. Western Europe became divided after the city of Rome fell to the barbarians. This parallels the feet in Daniel 2, which are mixed with iron and clay.</shortdescription>
    <article>&lt;B&gt;Ten horns&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Explained as “ten kings” (v. 24). If the “four kings” of v. 17 represent kingdoms (see on v. 3), parallel to the four empires of ch. 2, then there is fully as much reason to understand these “ten kings” as kingdoms also, even as the four horns of the goat are “four kingdoms” (ch. 8:22). The successive invasions of the Roman Empire by numerous Germanic tribes, and the replacement of the empire by a number of separate states or monarchies, are well established facts of history. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Owing to the fact that a score or more barbarian tribes invaded the Roman Empire, commentators have compiled various lists of the kingdoms that were founded. The following list is representative: Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Franks, Vandals, Suevi, Alamanni, Anglo-Saxons, Heruli, Lombards, Burgundians. Some prefer to list the Huns in place of the Alamanni, however the Huns disappeared early without leaving a settled kingdom. The period was one of great upheaval, confusion, and change, during which a large number of states secured their independence.</article>

    <shortdescription>The little horn that grows exceedingly great in Daniel 8 begins as a political power but turns into a religious and political power that casts some of the stars of heaven down and tramples on them. He exalts himself like God.</shortdescription>
    <article>Little Horn. A symbol in the book of Daniel (chs 7 and 8) for a great foe of God’s chosen people. To the Hebrews, originally a pastoral people familiar with the manner in which domestic animals such as rams and bulls used their horns for self-defense and attack, the horn naturally became a symbol of power. Passages that describe the “little horn” and its activities are chs 7:8, 20–26; 8:9–14, 23–26. Parallel passages whose context makes evident that the same power and same developments are being described in literal language are chs 9:26, 27; 11:29–45; 12:1, 6–11. The characteristics ascribed to the little horn in chs 7 and 8, and the activities attributed to it, lead to the conclusion that the two visions described the same power in different aspects of its activity and from a slightly different point of view. In each instance the “horn” is “little” when it is first seen on the prophetic stage (chs 7:8; 8:9), but in time it grows to be very great (chs 7:20; 8:9). In chs 7 it comes up “among” (v 8) and “after” (v 24) the 10 horns of the 4th terrible beast (v 7), displacing 3 of the 10 as it rises (vs 8, 20, 24), whereas the little horn of ch 8 comes forth after the “four notable” horns that replaced the “great horn” of the ram have appeared, toward the close of the dominion exercised by the 4 horns “when the transgressors are come to the full” (vs 23, 24). The little horn of ch 7 is said to have “eyes like the eyes of man” (vs 8, 20), and the little horn of ch 8 is said to be “cunning” in its methods of operation (v 25, RSV). The interpretation of the little horn of ch 7 clearly implies that it represents a “king” (v 24), whereas that of ch 8 is specifically declared to represent a “king” (v 23). The horn of ch 7 makes “war with the saints,” prevails against them, and wears them out (vs 21, 25); the horn of ch 8 casts down some of the “host,” that is, the “holy people,” to the ground and stamps upon them (vs 10, 13, 24). With its “mouth that spake very great things” the horn of ch 7 speaks “great words against the most High” and attempts “to change times and laws” ordained by the Most High (vs 20, 25); the horn of ch 8 “magnified himself even to the prince of the host” (v 11), who is described in v 25 as “the Prince of princes”—obviously the Lord—and “cast down the truth to the ground” (v 12). The period of time during which the little horn oppresses “the saints of the most High” is said to be “a time and times and the dividing of time” (Dan 7:25; cf. ch 12:7, “time, times, and an half”). The little horn of ch 8 takes away “the daily sacrifice” and casts down “the place of his sanctuary” (v 11), but after a period called “two thousand and three hundred days” (v 14) the sanctuary is “cleansed” (KJV), or “restored to its rightful state” (RSV). In ch 7 the coming of “the Ancient of days” in judgment deprives the little horn of its power and awards the kingdom to the “saints of the most High” (vs 18, 22, 26, 27). In ch 8, at the close of the specified period of time the sanctuary is “cleansed” of the “transgression of desolation” erected in it by the little horn (vs 13, 14). In ch 9:26, 27 the same power destroys Jerusalem and the Temple, causing “the sacrifice and the oblation to cease” and desolating the sanctuary. In ch 11:30, 31 the same power enters “the glorious land”—Palestine—(vs 16, 41, 45), stands up against “the prince of the covenant” (v 22), pollutes the sanctuary and takes away the daily sacrifice, sets up the desolating abomination (vs 30, 31), and conspires to obliterate the worship of the true God (v 30)—all for “a time, times, and an half” (ch 12:7).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Our Lord Himself applied the parallel prophecy of Dan 11:31 and 12:11 to the Romans (see Mt 24:15–20 cf. Lk 21:20–24), a prediction that was fulfilled in A.D. 70 when the latter destroyed Jerusalem and the Temple and brought the Jewish nation to an end. Some Protestant interpreters have adopted the ancient Jewish interpretation; others have applied the prophecy of the little horn, first to the events of A.D. 70, and second to papal Rome in past centuries, when it was intolerant of all dissent and dissenters and persecuted those who did not consent to its authority.</article>

    <shortdescription>Clovis the Frank defeated a major opponent to the papacy, thus solidifying the pope's authority over the remains of the Roman empire.</shortdescription>
    <article>Historians who give only brief treatment to this war generally focus on the year 507, during which Alaric was killed. Yet, as the above references correctly indicate, the Franks continued their conquest of Visigothic territory until well into the year 508. The conclusion of the war, and the imperial recognition of it, occurred in the year 508.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
"Nor was his a temporary conquest. The kingdom of the West Goths and the Burgundians had become the kingdom of the Franks. The invaders had at length arrived, who were to remain. It was decided that the Franks, and not the Goths, were to direct the future destinies of Gaul and Germany, and that the Catholic faith, and not Arianism, was to be the religion of these great realms." Richard W. Church, The Beginning of the Middle Ages, pp. 38, 39.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
"Thus in A.D. 508 terminated united resistance to the development of the papacy. The question of supremacy between Frank and Goth, between the Catholic and Arian religions, had then been settled in favor of the Catholics." Daniel and the Revelation, 1944 ed., p. 330.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
"Thus when Clovis and the Franks defeated the Arian Visigoths and drove them into Spain, it was also a theological victory for the bishop of Rome." William H. Shea, Bible Amplifier - Daniel 7-12, p. 220.</article>

    <shortdescription>There are two time prophecies in the last part of Daniel 12. The 1290 and 1335 day time prophecies are related to the other prophecies in Daniel and overlap a similar period of history. </shortdescription>
    <article>There are two time prophecies in the last part of Daniel 12. Verse 11 states, “And from the time that the daily sacrifice is taken away, and the abomination of desolation is set up, there shall be one thousand two hundred and ninety days” (NKJV). Verse 12 adds, “Blessed is he who waits, and comes to the one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days.” The 1290 and 1335 day time prophecies are related to the other prophecies in Daniel and overlap a similar period of history. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Building on the principle of repetition and enlargement, the 1290 days begin during Daniel’s time and extend to the time of the end just as the other major prophecies in this book (Daniel 2, Daniel 7, Daniel 8 and 9, and Daniel 10-12). These parallel prophecies cover the same sweep of time, emphasizing a different aspect. A historicist interpretation of the 1290 days understands these prophetic days are 1290 years. They begin in 508 A.D. and terminate in 1798 A.D., the same ending date for the 1260 year prophecy (see Daniel 12:7). The 1335 day prophecy extends 45 years beyond 1798 to 1843/44 when a crucial event took place in heaven.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;The Abomination of Desolation and 1290 Days&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
What is the “abomination of desolation” that comes after the “daily” is taken away spoken of in Daniel 12:11? In a parallel passage, Daniel 11:31 also describes “the daily” being taken away. In chapter 11 we understand Christ’s intercessory ministry was usurped by the work of priests through the mass and confessional. By sacrificing Christ anew in every mass, a religious power has removed Christ’s heavenly ministry. This “taking away” which prepares for the abomination of desolation marks the beginning point of the 1290 year prophecy. Something happened in the sixth century to establish the abomination of desolation.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In 496, Clovis, king of the Franks, joined the Catholic faith. Germanic tribes dismantled the Roman Empire and opposed the pope in Rome. But Clovis defeated the Visigoths and became the very first government power to join with the rising Roman Church. After defeating the Goths he met Byzantine representatives in 508 who named him an honorary consul of Rome. Here was the first connection between church and state (Franks and papacy) to form a union to enforce religious legislation. It is the beginning of the abomination of desolation. Strange as it may seem, the same country that first joined ranks with the church in Rome was the same country that brought about its demise in 1798 when Napoleon had the pope taken prisoner.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Some interpreters see the “daily” that is taken away in Daniel 12:11 (and 8:11) as “paganism” and a persecuting power (pagan Rome) which made way for the abomination of desolation brought on by a new persecuting power (papal Rome). Regardless of how the “daily” is interpreted, it is clear that an apostate religious power comes into play and continues the work of removing Christ’s atoning work in heaven and enforcing a teaching to the point of persecution.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;The 1335 Days&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
There is no specific event mentioned for the beginning of the 1335 days (years), but the context shows that it began at the same time as the 1290 days (years). If this is true and both prophecies begin at the same time, then the 1335 prophecy would end 45 years after 1798, which would be 1843. This time period was the ending of the longest time prophecy in Scripture, the 2300 day (year) prophecy of Daniel 8:14. It marked not only the great advent awakening, but the cleansing work in the heavenly sanctuary in which Christ moved from His role as our High Priest from the Holy Place to the Most Holy Place. Jesus’ role in heaven as our intercessor took on greater significance as He began the work of the cleansing the heavenly sanctuary sin, just as the earthly sanctuary portrayed in the Day of Atonement service.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Though some Bible students seek to interpret the 1290 and 1335 day prophecies as literal years still in the future, this cannot be supported from Daniel where there are clear connections between the major prophecies. Daniel 12:11, 12 is not a new prophecy covering a different period of history. Daniel 12:6 asks, “How long shall the fulfillment of these wonders be?” and indicates a reference to Daniel 11 and the taking away of the daily, also spoken of there.</article>

    <shortdescription>The message to the church of Thyatira speaks of the apostasy of the church in the Dark Ages and later Middle Ages. The Bible was unavailable to most and tradition was lifted up. People sought salvation by works. It also speaks of the reformation.</shortdescription>
    <article>Continuing through the circle of seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, Christ gives a message to the fourth church named Thyatira. This church moved beyond compromise and into apostasy. Strong language describes events in Thyatira: Jezebel, sexual immorality, and tribulation. Thyatira fits a period of medieval church history just before the time of the reformation. It was the “Age of Adversity” when salvation by works was promoted. The church at this time began to move in the right direction when the doctrine of salvation by faith in Jesus Christ was presented by the reformers.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;A Corrupt Church&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Thyatira was located about 30 miles southeast of Pergamos. It was city known for a flourishing number of crafts and trades. It was prominent for dyeing cloth. The name of this city may mean “sweet savor of labor” and would describe how this church was known for its “works, love, service, and faith” (v. 19). Thyatira had corruption in its midst, but not all had apostatized.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Christ is presented to this church as “the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and His feet like fine brass” (Revelation 2:18). The church sees Jesus from head to foot. His eyes see their works. His feet are strong and firm. Christ is not easily moved as He condemns “that woman Jezebel” who seduces “My servants to commit sexual immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols” (v. 20). A pure woman, in Scripture, represents God’s true church. Jezebel, an immoral woman, depicts a church in apostasy. She has been unfaithful to doctrine. This describes the power of the corrupt church of the Dark Ages. During this time medieval Christianity absorbed pagan forms and practices.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
God called the church to repent but “she did not”, so she and her spiritual “children” will suffer great tribulation. The mother harlot and her offspring present a church with its adherents facing serious consequences for allowing a mixture of truth and error into the teachings of the Bible. It might be difficult to read, “I will kill her children” (v. 23), but it reminds us of what will ultimately happen when turning away from God, the source of life. The Old Testament story of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel helps us understand how much the Lord hates apostasy. The Israelites mixed paganism into their religious ceremonies. It was detestable to God. Remember what happened to Ahab’s “children” (see 2 Kings 10:7)? They were put to death.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Yet, not all have gone astray in Thyatira. “To the rest,” Jesus says, “Hold fast what you have till I come” (v. 25). Not all have followed the false church or have “known the depths of Satan” (v. 24) or his ways. God has a remnant in every age that remains faithful to their vows of Christianity. During the Dark Ages religious and political powers joined hands to persecute God’s people. But Revelation promises those who overcome, “I will give power over the nations” (v. 26). The coming of the Protestant Reformation helped move the church back in the right direction. Great men like Martin Luther stood up against the church and the state to hold up truth. Even the language of v. 28 about the “morning star” has been used to describe the bright works of John Wycliffe, one of the earlier Protestant reformers.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Churches in Apostasy&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
There are churches today that have followed compromise into apostasy. Bible truth has been replaced by the traditions of mankind. Many have never stopped to consider that long cherished beliefs have no foundation in Scripture but come from a mixture of pagan ideas and some Bible truths. Like the church in Thyatira we must not commit “sexual immorality” by spiritually becoming adulterated with false teachings. Search the Scriptures. Hold fast to truth.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In the same vein there are churches who seek acceptance in the community but compromise Bible standards. The desire to receive the praise from secular leaders and politicians lead some faith communities to become like Jezebel and mix truth with error. The message of Christ to Thyatira is relevant to churches in our day which have “eaten food sacrificed to idols”, churches that will compromise Bible teachings in order to gain acceptance in the world. Someday false churches and false religions will be “dashed to pieces like the potter’s vessels’” (v. 27).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>The 1260 day prophecy is referenced over seven times in the Bible and used to describe how long God's people would be persecuted.</shortdescription>
    <article>The Bible predicted that God’s true people would be persecuted for a period of 1260 prophetic days. This prophecy foretold that God’s church would flee into the wilderness to be kept safe. The 1260 days are also described as “a time and times and half a time” (Revelation 12:14), 42 months (11:2) and or three and a half years. These “days” are to be understood as prophetic days, or actual years according to the “day for a year” principle of prophetic interpretation (see Numbers 14:34 and Ezekiel 4:4-6). In Daniel 7, this is the period in which the “little horn” rules. A historicist interpretation of this prophecy places it from A.D. 538 to 1798 during which the apostate church sought to destroy “heretics” who were in fact God’s remnant people.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Daniel 7&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
In Daniel’s vision of four beasts that came up from the sea, the fourth was “dreadful and terrible” (Daniel 7:7). Daniel “wished to know the truth about the fourth beast” (v. 19) and the little horn that “was making war against the saints, and prevailing against them” (v. 21). The beast is identified as a kingdom and the horns on the beast as “ten kings” (v. 24). The little horn arises after them and subdues three kings. Then it says, “He shall speak pompous words against the Most High, shall persecute the saints of the Most High, and shall intend to change times and law. Then the saints shall be given into his hand for a time and times and half a time” (v. 25).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
A “time” (year) and “times” (two years) and “half a time” (1/2 a year) can be understood as 3 ½ years (or 42 months). Since a prophetic year equals 12 months of 30 prophetic days, this would add up to 1260 prophetic days. In order to clearly understand the meaning of this time frame, we find elsewhere in Scripture the principle of taking a day for a year in prophecy. One application is found in Numbers 14:34. Israel failed to enter the Promised Land because of their lack of faith. Then God told them that for every “day” they spied out the land they would remain in the wilderness for a “year” (40 days = 40 years). And so, the 1260 days can be understood as 1260 years during which the little horn power would persecute God’s people.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Revelation 12&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
The same basic prophecy is described in Revelation 12 when a pure woman, who represents the church, is about to give birth and a dragon waits to devour her child. When her Child (Christ) is “caught up to God and His throne” (v. 5) the woman (church) “fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, that they should feed her there one thousand two hundred and sixty days” (v. 6). Later in the chapter the dragon persecutes the woman who “was given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the presence of the serpent” (v. 14). Here we see the same prophecy repeated in different language. Who is this power led by the dragon (Satan) that goes off to “make war with the rest of her offspring, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ” (v. 17)?&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;The Apostate Church&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
The persecution of God’s church first came through pagan Rome. The Bible predicted that apostasy would eventually come from within the church (see Matthew 24:4, 5 and Acts 20:29). As the authority of the local church eroded, the bishop of Rome emerged as the supreme power within Christianity. Under this leadership the Christian church fell even deeper into apostasy. Compromises between paganism and Christianity led to a system of false religion.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When the Roman emperor Justinian declared the bishop of Rome as the head over all the churches, his general (Belisarius) liberated Rome in A.D. 538. Now the bishop could exercise all the powers granted him as the “Holy See.” This is the beginning date of the 1260 year prophecy. Soon the church, with the assistance of the state, attempted to force her decrees on all Christians. Many were imprisoned or executed during this time in the name of God. Then, in 1798, 1260 years after A.D. 538, the papacy received a deadly blow (see Revelation 13:3) when Napoleon’s army placed the pope at the mercy of the French government. At Napoleon’s orders General Berthier entered Rome and put an end to the political rule of the papacy. This marked the end of the 1260 year prophecy.</article>

    <shortdescription>Revelation 13 symbolically describes 2 beasts that are allies with a dragon. This false trinity wages an end time war against God’s people. All three evil powers work cooperatively with the church &amp; state to enforce worship to the image of the beast.</shortdescription>
    <article>Revelation 13 symbolically describes two beasts that are allies with a dragon. This false trinity wages an end time war against God’s people. All three evil powers work cooperatively with the church and state to enforce worship to the image of the beast. Both beasts, one from the sea and the other from the land, mimic characteristics of Christ and the Holy Spirit. Before Christ comes this apostate religious union will seek to cause all on the earth to receive a mark signifying their loyalty to this power to the point of death. Both beasts ultimately receive their power from the dragon, identified in Revelation 12:9 as “that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world.”&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;The Sea Beast&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
The first beast, described in Revelation 13:1, rises “up out of the sea” and has seven heads, ten horns, and ten crowns. It appears as a mixture of beasts (like a leopard, feet like a bear, mouth like a lion) described in Daniel 7:4-8. It receives authority from the dragon and at some point is “mortally wounded” (v. 3). But later this wound was healed and people marveled, wondered, and worshiped the beast.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Bible scholars for hundreds of years have understood this first beast to represent the papacy which grew in power after the time of the dragon (Imperial Rome), especially during the Middle Ages. It came up “out of the sea” meaning among a more populated part of the earth. The dragon, which primarily represents Satan, used the Roman Empire to establish this sea beast. It was given authority for 42 months. In Bible prophecy a day stands for a year, so 42 months equals 1260 years. With a beginning date of 538 A.D. when the papal power was set in place, we determine the ending date when in 1798 Berthier, the head of the French army, entered Rome and took the pope prisoner, temporarily ending the papacy’s power. Yet over a period of time this “wound was healed” (v. 3).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;The Land Beast&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Another beast is described in Revelation 13 that is different from the sea beast. This one is “coming up out of the earth” (v. 11). It has two “lamb like” horns but speaks “like a dragon.” Though this beast begins small, from a less densely populated area of the earth sometime after the wound of the first beast, it grows in power. Many Bible scholars see the United States of America fitting this beast power. As a Protestant nation with religious influence in the world, it will someday join hands with the other beast to enforce its laws. Taking a lead role, the land beast helps re-establish the work of the sea beast in preparation for final events on earth. Just as the Holy Spirit came like fire down from heaven, this beast power will also do great signs and wonders. It institutes a death penalty toward all who will not worship the image of the beast.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;The Mark of the Beast&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
As a form of control, the beast powers will institute measures to coerce people to worship the image of the beast. Revelation describes “the mark of the beast” as a way to identify the followers of the beast. This mark, symbolic in nature, is in the foreheads and hands of people, indicating consent of mind and action to the laws of this power. People cannot “buy or sell” unless they have this mark. The seal of God stands in contrast to the mark of the beast. God’s seal is found on those who keep His commandments (14:1, 12). The fourth commandment, the seventh day Sabbath, contains the heart of God’s covenant with His people, showing His name, title, and basis of authority (Creator). The counterfeit seal (the mark of the beast) would stand in opposition of the true Bible Sabbath. Papal Rome has clearly established her authority to change God’s law when it claims, by her own authority, to make Sunday as the true day of worship.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As an added way to confirm the identity of this first beast power, Revelation says the “number of the beast” (which is different that than the “mark of the beast”) is the number of a man. The number 666 can be understood to apply to the title of the papacy. It is also a number that is deceptively close to God’s perfect number of seven. The mark of the beast is not some secret number embedded under the skin or tattooed on the body. It has nothing to do with Social Security numbers or computer codes. It simply symbolizes the choice of those who follow man’s laws over God’s Ten Commandments.</article>

    <article>Though prosecution of heretics by secular governments with the pope's authority had existed prior, the practice became more frequent in the 12th century, primarily in response to the spread of Catharism. The Church ordained councils consisting of bishops and archbishops to establish tribunals called inquisitions to expose and punish what the Church deemed heresy. The first of these Inquisitions was established in Languedoc, in the south of France, in 1184A.D.</article>

    <shortdescription>John Wycliffe was a powerful early Reformer who lived and worked in England.</shortdescription>
    <article>John Wycliffe was born in 1328 to a land-owning English family. His life can be understood best in three stages. During the first stage of his life, Wycliffe was involved at Oxford. Although he began as a student,he eventually became Master of Balliol College. In order to pay for his studies, Wycliffe accepted an ecclesiastical office, which enabled him to continue his education at Oxford until 1371. During this period he became well recognized as a philosopher and theologian. Also, near the end of this time, Wycliffe became known for his radical views on church governance, which asserted Christ as the head of the church and insisted that ungodly leaders have no rightful authority.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The second stage of Wycliffe’s life was between 1371 and 1378.During this time, Wycliffe spoke out against the unprecedented wealth of the Catholic Church, which at the time was exempt from taxes. As a result of his threatening teachings, Wycliffe relied heavily on the protection of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster. However, when King Edward III died in 1377, the duke’s power was significantly reduced. In addition, in 1378 the Great Papal Schism (during which there were three rival popes at one point) began, and the church was more easily manipulated. This meant that the English government did not need as much support from the teachings of Wycliffe. As a result, even at this early stage of the English Reformation, the primary reforms were prompted more from political than theological reasons. This motivating factor continued to permeate throughout the English Reformation in subsequent years.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The third stage in Wycliffe’s life began in 1378 and ended with his death. With less demand on his public services, Wycliffe was able to get back to his studies. As his ideas became even more radical in the eyes of the church, he was dismissed from Oxford and retreated to Lutterworth. While there, Wycliffe devoted his time to writing and preaching. It was during this time that he began translating the Bible into English from the Latin Vulgate,one of his greatest contributions to the reformation. Wycliffe lived in Lutterworth until he suffered two strokes, the first in 1382 and the second in1384, which resulted in his death.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Strangely enough, Wycliffe’s story does not end with his death. On May 4, 1415, at the Council of Constance, Wycliffe was declared a heretic. In 1428, 44 years after Wycliffe’s death, Pope Martin V commanded that the body of John Wycliffe be exhumed and publicly burned. After this took place,his ashes were thrown into the River Swift, which ran through Lutterworth.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Some of John Wycliffe’s important works include:The Truth of Holy Scripture—which upheld the Bible as the standard of authority for which all others are tested,including the pope; The Power of the Pope—which illustrated that the papacy was an office established by man, not God; and On the Eucharist—which denied the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation (that the elements of the Lord’s supper change literally into the body and blood of Christ).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Huss was an early Reformer in Bohemia. He died a martyr's death.</shortdescription>
    <article>John Huss was born about 1372 to a poor Bohemian family. In 1390, he began his studies at the University of Prague. In 1401, Jerome of Prague brought many of John Wycliffe’s more radical works to Bohemia (essentially modern-day Czech Republic). Around this same time (1402), Huss was elected rector and preacher of the Bethlehem Chapel in Prague. Greatly influenced by Wycliffe, Huss began to echo his teachings—that the authority of church leaders was corrupt and the Word of God could be the only true guide.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In 1403, the writings of Wycliffe were banned from the University of Prague; however, this was due to the vote of the German majority. In fact, there were three times as many Germans than Bohemians. Nevertheless, by 1409 the king of Bohemia was able to oust the German majority (which resulted in the Germans founding their own university in Leipzig) and appointed Huss as rector of the University of Prague.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Huss met immediate resistance from the Archbishop of Prague, a man named Zbynek. The archbishop secured a mandate from the pope that forbid preaching in all chapels, but Huss refused to obey this command and continued to preach. As a result, the Archbishop of Prague excommunicated Huss in 1410. At this same time, the archbishop ordered that 200 volumes of Wycliffe’s works be publicly burned.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Tensions in Papal Europe continued to escalate, and in 1412 Pope John XXIII began a crusade against Naples. Enraged even more by the ungodly actions of the pope, Huss spoke out against Rome even more fervently. As a result, Huss was officially excommunicated from the headquarters in Rome and the entire city of Prague was placed under papal interdict (which denied all citizens access to the Church and its sacraments) until Huss could be removed. Huss eventually complied and withdrew to southern Bohemia, where he spent his time writing.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In 1414 the Council of Constance began attempts to heal the Great Papal Schism (during which there were three rival popes). Emperor Sigismund invited Huss to attend and promised to give him safe conduct. Huss was hesitant but decided to go. Within a month, he was captured by papal loyalists and imprisoned. Huss waited in prison until his trial on July 6, 1415. The authorities at the council demanded that Huss recant his beliefs, but he refused. As a result, Huss was dragged outside of the city and burned at the stake.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Huss’s martyrdom enraged his followers in Bohemia. Civil war eventually broke out, but the reform movement continued. Eventually, the followers of Huss became connected with the Waldensians, and during the Protestant Reformation they merged with the followers of Martin Luther and John Calvin.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Some of John Huss’s important works include: The Church and Simony.</article>

    <shortdescription>Papal Schism that lasted nearly four decades. At one point there were three popes all claiming to be the Vicar of Christ.
</shortdescription>
    <article>The Great Papal Schism began after the death of Pope Gregory XI. When the conclave of cardinals gathered in April 1378 to elect a new pope, they were practically forced by an angry mob to choose an Italian. A cardinal archbishop named Prignano was selected and became the new pope—Urban VI.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Urban VI quickly showed himself to have a violent temper and an autocratic style of leadership. He began insulting the French cardinals, demanding they stop their “stupid babbling.” Soon the crisis reached a breaking point. The majority of cardinals called a gathering on August 9, 1378, and annulled the election of Pope Urban VI. In turn, they elected Robert of Geneva, a Frenchman, as the new pope in September 1378. The cardinals further decided that Avignon would again be recognized as the papal headquarters and Robert took the name Clement VII.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Now with two rival popes, the Western church was divided. Neither pope was willing to give in to the other, and both were ready to fight to keep their position. For 11 years Urban VI and Clement VII struggled for complete papal power. Urban VI died on October 15, 1389. The next pope in this line was Boniface IX (1389–1404). Innocent VII (1404–1406) came after Boniface, followed by Gregory XII (1406–1415). The other line of popes continued after the death of Clement VII (1394) by Benedict XIII (1394–1422).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Great Papal Schism became the concern of the entire Western church. Since the popes were not willing to give up their power, the solution had to come from outside the papacy. The universities were heavily involved. The prominent theory used is known today as the conciliar theory, which essentially suggested that a general council should have supremacy over the pope. This led to the Council of Pisa, which began on March 25, 1409.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Council of Pisa hoped to provide the solution, but it actually added to the controversy. During the council, Pierre Philargis was elected as pope in order to dispel the other two claimants. But the Council of Pisa merely added another pope to the conquest for power. Now there were three rival popes, all claiming to be the successor of Peter and the true Vicar of Christ.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Philargis didn’t survive long and died within a year of his election. Balthasar Cossa was elected to replace him, becoming John XXIII. On November 5, 1414, the Council of Constance was opened to again attempt a resolution. All three popes were invited to attend, but John XXIII was the only one who came. As a result of the council, John XXIII was deposed, Gregory XII reluctantly resigned, and Benedict XIII fled to Spain and lived in exile until his death. In their place, the council elected Otto Colonna, who became Pope Martin V in November 1417. After 39 years, the Great Papal Schism was ended.</article>

    <shortdescription>John Wycliffe's disciples in England became known as the Lollards. They prepared the way for the English reformation by distributing the English Bible.
</shortdescription>
    <article>The Lollards were a group of Christians largely made up of John Wycliffe’s followers. It is not clear whether all of the Lollards were Wycliffites, but nevertheless they shared his convictions. Furthermore, the precise origin of the Lollards is debated among scholars. John Wycliffe certainly had followers during his lifetime, but it was probably not until after his death that some of them began to take the name ‘Lollards.’&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Lollards were convicted that the Bible was for the people and, therefore, worked to translate the Bible into English. They would also preach against pastors holding civil offices, the worship of images, the requirement of clerical celibacy, and pilgrimages. Like Wycliffe, the Lollards also rejected the doctrine of transubstantiation (that the elements of the Lord’s supper change literally into the body and blood of Christ) and prayers for the dead.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Lollards were very radical and sometimes prone to civil disturbance. Nevertheless, not all the Lollards resorted to violent measures. In actuality, much of the work they did, especially in translating the Bible into English, prepared the way for the English Reformation. It is during the English Reformation that the Lollards begin to disappear by simply merging with other English reformers.</article>

    <shortdescription>Huss's attempts at reform were halted by his excommunication from the church in 1410 by "antipope" Alexander V.</shortdescription>
    <article>Pope Alexander V empowered the Archbishop to take action against all forms of Wycliffism, including the Hussite reforms, in his papal bull dated 20 December 1409. It mandated the surrender of all his books, the revocation of his doctrines, and the cessation of free preaching. Hus appealed to the pope after the bull's publication in 1410 to no avail. Hus and his followers were excommunicated, and all Wycliffe's material was burned.</article>

    <shortdescription>An ecumenical council held from 1414 to 1418. It ended the Great Papal Schism and elected Pope Martin V. Also condemned and executed John Huss.
</shortdescription>
    <article>The Council of Constance officially opened on November 5, 1414, and lasted three-and-a-half years. In total, it consisted of 45 full sessions, along with other various committee meetings and various gatherings. The council was heavily attended and represented every part of Christendom. In addition to numerous delegates, 29 cardinals, 3 patriarchs, 33 archbishops, 150 bishops, more than 100 abbots, and around 300 theologians attended the council at some point.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The council was monumental on several accounts. First, it was voted that the supreme authority of the church rested in the ecumenical council. Second, the pope is always subject to the judgment on the ecumenical council. Third, it is possible for a pope to err and even become a heretic. Lastly, the pope can be removed from office if they fail to serve the church.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In addition to limiting papal power, Constance also ended the Great Papal Schism (during which there were three rival popes) by deposing previous claimants and electing Martin V as the new pope, declared John Wycliffe a heretic 31 years after his death, and condemned John Huss for heresy and burned him at the stake.</article>

    <shortdescription>Called by Pope Martin V to deal with the question of papal supremacy and with the Hussite heresy.
</shortdescription>
    <article>Pope Martin V called the Council of Basel in 1431, but he died before it was able to convene. Eugenius IV came to power next and was strongly against the conciliar movement (which claimed the authority of a general council was above the authority of the pope). Therefore, Eugenius dissolved the council before it officially began and devoted his pontificate to the restoration of papal supremacy. The pope met almost immediate resistance. Two factions arose as a result. Some were loyal to the pope, who had set up a different council in an Italian city, Ferrara. Two years later that council was moved to Florence. The other group resisted Eugenius IV by staying in Basel and holding their own council. At this council in Basel, the delegates deposed Eugenius and elected their own pope, Felix V, in 1439. However, Eugenius proved to be too powerful and Felix resigned in 1449. The Council of Basel was then moved to Lausanne, where it voted to dissolve itself.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
While the Council of Basel was convened, it also attempted to put out the Hussite movement. After the martyrdom of John Huss, there was a national protest in Bohemia. In 1420 the Hussites published the Four Articles of Prague, which demanded the freedom to preach and the end of worldly power within the church, among other things. However, the Hussites were perfectly united. The Taborites were the more radical of the two main groups. The Taborites held that any practice not specifically outlined in the Bible must be given up. They did not venerate saints, pray for the dead, believe in transubstantiation, or the validity of indulgences.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The other Hussite group was known as the Utraquists. This group gave up their beliefs and was reunited with the Catholic Church at the Council of Basel. Nevertheless, this was not the consensus of all of the Hussites, and the remnant of this movement upheld their beliefs and later joined the Protestant Reformation.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>A Bible printed with movable type and the first major book produced on a printing press.
</shortdescription>
    <article>The first edition of Jerome of Prague’s Latin Vulgate was the first major book to be printed on the Gutenberg Press. As a result, it became known as the Gutenberg Bible and was printed circa 1455. Shortly thereafter, many other religious books were printed on the Gutenberg Press. As a result of this printing press, the Bible and other religious works were made available to the people at an affordable price. By 1501 there were more that 110 places in Europe that had at least one printing press. Some cities, like Venice, had numerous presses.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As a result of the Gutenberg Press, the Protestant Reformation could spread like wildfire. It took merely two weeks for Luther’s Ninety-five Theses to be distributed throughout Germany. The rest of Europe had access to Luther’s work within a month.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>A Catholic scholar committed to reforming the church from within. He never formally joined the reformation movement he lived to see.
</shortdescription>
    <article>Desiderius Erasmus was born in the Netherlands to a priest. Sometime in his childhood, both of his parents passed away and Erasmus fell into the care of guardians. Instead of caring for him at home, his guardians sent him to a school in Deventer. In 1487 he entered into an Augustinian monastery and was ordained as a priest in 1492. In 1495 he began his studies at the University of Paris, which was the center of Scholasticism (a mixture of theology based primarily on Tradition and philosophy). Erasmus was quickly bored by the theological debates that took place and left for England in 1499.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In England, Erasmus was inspired to study the New Testament through the influence of John Colet. He quickly headed back to mainland Europe and began studying Greek in 1500. Nine years later he returned to England as a Greek instructor and lecturer in divinity at Cambridge University. In 1516 he published a Greek New Testament with annotations and his own Latin translation. The second edition of this book came out in 1519.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Erasmus was the most well-known scholar in Europe at the dawn of the Protestant Reformation. As a result of his fame, Erasmus was a powerful force during the Reformation. He persistently attacked monasticism, corrupt clergymen, and even the papacy itself. He also criticized cardinals and bishops for their various abuses in the church. Erasmus’ attacks were so forceful that after the Reformation began, his books were added to the Catholic’s Index of Prohibited Books along with the works of Martin Luther and other reformers.</article>

In addition, this bishop of Meaux encouraged the people within his diocese to read the Scriptures.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
After Emperor Charles V captured King Francis I of France, Briconnet was accused of heresy. As a result, Briconnet did not join with the Protestant Reformation but began openly contradicting Luther in 1523.</article>

    <shortdescription>Pope from 1513 to 1521. He granted indulgences to those who donated to the reconstruction of St. Peter's Basilica. Also challenged the Ninety-five Theses of Martin Luther.
</shortdescription>
    <article>Pope Leo X held the position of the bishop of Rome, or pope, from 1513–1521. During his papacy he accomplished much for the cause of Rome. In 1516 he wrote Pastor Aeternus, which effectively put an end to the conciliar movement (which claimed the authority of a general council was above the authority of the pope) that became forceful at the Council of Constance. As a result, the pope was again declared to hold the highest authority within the Catholic Church.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In order to rebuild St. Peter’s Cathedral, which remains standing in Vatican City, Leo X renewed the sale of indulgences. Indulgence preachers were soon hired to promote this endeavor. Perhaps the most well-known indulgence preacher at the time was John Tetzel. Martin Luther openly rebuked Tetzel and other indulgence preachers. As a result, Pope Leo X excommunicated Martin Luther on January 3, 1521. Leo X died of malaria in December of that same year.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>An English lawyer and counselor to Henry VIII who opposed the Protestant Reformation.
</shortdescription>
    <article>Thomas More was a lawyer and, for a time, chancellor to King Henry VIII. More was ardently against the Protestant Reformation and took special offense to both Martin Luther and William Tyndale. Near the end of More’s life, King Henry VIII began to change the laws of the Church of England. More began to oppose the king and his radical changes. The final break between the two men came when Henry VIII declared himself to be the head of the Church of England in the Act of Supremacy. Anyone who disagreed with the king’s new decree was pronounced a heretic. As a result, More was imprisoned and eventually executed in the Tower of London in 1535.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In 1516, More published the popular book Utopia. In 1935, Thomas More was canonized as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church for his reactions to Henry VIII and Protestantism in general.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>German monk and professor of theology who challenged the sale of indulgences by the Roman Catholic Church.
</shortdescription>
    <article>Martin Luther was born in the east German town of Eisleben in 1483. Luther eventually joined the Augustinian friars in Erfurt and began to study theology. In time, he became a professor of theology at the University of Wittenberg. In 1517, Luther wrote his Ninety-five Theses and nailed them to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg on October 31 of that same year.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Luther’s Ninety-five Theses reacted strongly against three main issues: the extravagant expenditures of the papacy, the abuse of papal authority (especially over purgatory), and the abomination of the sale of indulgences.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When Luther publicized his Ninety-five Theses, his intent was not to overthrow the system. Luther was apparently unaware that his radical ideas threatened the very authority of the papacy or ecumenical councils. It was during Luther’s interviews with Cardinal Cajetan (October 12–14, 1518) that he realized for the first time that the pope claimed authority over the Scriptures. Furthermore, Luther was not aware that his supreme view of the Scriptures came into conflict with ecumenical councils until the Leipzig Debate in 1519. It was not until 1520, three years after his Ninety-five Theses, that Luther began to openly write and declare that the authority of Scripture was above the pope and ecumenical councils.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As a result, Luther began devoting his life to the Scriptures, proclaiming their supreme authority. On January 3, 1521, Luther was excommunicated from the Catholic Church, which enabled Protestantism to flourish. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Shortly after his excommunication, Martin Luther stood before the Diet of Worms and refused to recant his beliefs. After taking that stand for his faith, Martin Luther went into hiding in the Wartburg Castle and began translating the New Testament into German. His New Testament was published in September 1522 and, by 1534, about 200,000 copies had been sold. By 1534 Luther had finished translating the Old Testament and in September the Wittenberg Bible became available to the public.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Throughout his life, Martin Luther wrote many treatises and booklets. Some of the most important include: Ninety-five Thesis (1517), The Freedom of a Christian (1520), The Babylonian Captivity of the Church (1520), On Secular Authority (1523), The Freedom of the Will (1524), The Bondage of the Will (1525), The Small Catechism (1529), The Large Catechism (1529), and his Commentary on Galatians (1531).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Martin Luther died in 1546. His death was held in tremendous honor. Three funeral sermons were delivered. The first sermon was given in his hometown of Eisleben. Two more were given in Wittenberg, the first by Johannes Bugenhagen and the second by Philip Melanchthon.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>A leader of the reformation movement in Switzerland.
</shortdescription>
    <article>Ulrich Zwingli was born January 1, 1484, in Wildhaus, Toggenburg, located in eastern Switzerland. Much of Zwingli’s childhood was spent in his alpine homeland observing nature and reflecting on the Creator.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Zwingli began his studies in Vienna but finished them in Basle. In 1504 he received his bachelor’s degree and then a master’s degree in 1506. It was also in 1506 that Zwingli met a man named Thomas Wyttenbach, who led Zwingli away from useless philosophical thinking to a pastoral lifestyle. As a result, Zwingli was ordained on September 29, 1506, as the parish priest of Glarus.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
During these early years, Zwingli was a loyal priest devoted to his duties. However, in 1518 Zwingli began preaching from the Bible in a systematic manner. He even preached from entire Bible books, a radical practice at the time. This led Zwingli to begin his reformation writing. His first reformation work was written in 1522. Over the next few years, Zwingli’s reforms were so powerful in Switzerland that by 1525 the Mass was abolished in Zurich.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Roman Catholic Church was threatened by Zwingli and war broke out in Switzerland in 1529. During the war Zwingli was working as chaplain and died on the battlefield at Kappel. Because Zwingli was considered a heretic, his body was burned and his ashes disseminated.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Nevertheless, Zwingli is considered the founder of Swiss Protestantism, and the work he started didn’t end with his death.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Some of his important works include The Clarity and Certainty of God’s Word and Confession of Faith.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Part of the English Reformation, he was burned at the stake in October 1555.
</shortdescription>
    <article>Hugh Latimer was born around 1485 and began studying Latin at the age of four. He later attended Cambridge University and in 1510 became associated with Clare College. In his early life, Latimer was opposed to the Protestant Reformation and, while in college, devoted his time to refuting reformation theology. Eventually, a man named Thomas Bilney came into Latimer’s life and things began to change. Bilney helped to convert Latimer, and the two men began preaching against papal tyranny.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In 1539 Latimer spoke out against King Henry VIII’s Six Articles, which resulted in his imprisonment in the Tower of London. When Edward VI came to power, Latimer was released from prison and began to preach again. However, Edward VI’s reign was short, and when “Bloody” Mary I came to power, Latimer was again imprisoned and put on trial. His trial began on April 14, 1554, but he resisted papal accusers by placing his faith in the Bible and the Bible only.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Eventually, as papist rulers grew tired of Latimer’s resistance, he was tied to a stake outside of Balliol College in Oxford and burned alive in October 1555.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Latimer is remembered for rejecting the Catholic idea of transubstantiation (that the elements of the Lord’s supper change literally into the body and blood of Christ) and the meritorious nature of the Mass.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Archbishop of Canterbury and leader of the English Reformation. He was martyred in 1556.
</shortdescription>
    <article>In 1533 Thomas Cranmer became the archbishop of Canterbury. In that same year, Thomas Cromwell became the most prominent person in the royal government of England. Both of these men were empathetic with the Protestant cause. As a result, both diligently worked to incorporate Protestant theology into the first doctrinal documents of the English Reformation. In 1536, the Ten Articles were written, and then in 1537, the Bishop’s Book went to press. Both books were extremely influential in spreading Protestant teachings throughout the land. In fact, by 1538 it became royal law that an English Bible would be found in every parish church.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Unfortunately, in July 1540, the king became convinced that Thomas Cromwell was a heretic and executed him along with some of Cromwell’s other colleagues. Nevertheless, Thomas Cranmer managed to escape and, after king Henry VIII’s death in 1547, continued to lead out in the English Reformation.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
However, Cranmer did not experience unlimited freedom to express his religious views. King Edward VI came to power at the age of nine and was not able to rule authoritatively. As a result, Cranmer only had limited support. Nevertheless, in July 1547, he began preaching a 12-sermon series that focused on the doctrine of justification by faith alone and the supreme authority of the Bible. Between 1549 and 1552, Cranmer was involved in preparing the first Book of Common Prayer. In June 1553, he prepared the Forty-two Articles, which promulgated his views on justification by faith and the authority of Scripture. King Edward VI died less than a month after this publication, and “Bloody” Mary steered the Church of England back toward Roman Catholicism.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Shortly after Mary Tudor became queen of England, Cranmer was imprisoned for two-and-a-half years. During this time, he was pressured to give up his faith, but he never did. As a result he was burned at the stake in 1556, only two years before the death of Queen Mary in November 1558.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>A French evangelist and founder of the Reformed Church. Part of the circle of Meaux and worked closely with John Calvin.

    <article>William Farel was born in 1489. His life was devoted to preaching and speaking out against the Roman Church. He was a student of Jacques Lefèvre in his early years. In 1532 he settled down in Geneva, Switzerland. Farel was also the man responsible for convincing John Calvin to stay in Geneva and turn the city into the ideal Christian society. Although Farel was a good friend of Calvin’s, his theology was closer to that of Martin Luther. Ironically, by disagreeing with John Calvin, William Farel was banished from Geneva in 1538. After this took place, Farel moved to Neuchâtel where he lived until his death in 1565.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>An English reformer who became known for translating the Bible into English.
</shortdescription>
    <article>William Tyndale was born in 1495 in a town called Gloucestershire. In 1512 he attended Oxford University and earned a master’s degree. Tyndale was very educated, especially in linguistics. He spoke seven different languages. As a result, he began to translate the Bible into English from Greek and Hebrew. However, this was an illegal act. According to the Constitution of Oxford on 1408, it was illegal for an individual to translate the Bible into English. Nevertheless, Tyndale resorted to illegal means and left for Germany in 1524 to work on his translation.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In early 1526, William Tyndale’s version of the New Testament was printed in Worms. It wasn’t long before copies were illegally brought back to England. Tyndale then moved to Antwerp to work on translating the Old Testament. By 1535 he had translated the Pentateuch and the book of Jonah, but he was double-crossed before the completion of the Old Testament. Henry Phillips, Tyndale’s supposed disciple, betrayed Tyndale to the authorities, who put him into prison. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
While Tyndale was in prison, Miles Coverdale (1488–1568) finished translating the Old Testament, but not from Hebrew sources. Coverdale did not know Hebrew and used Latin sources, which incorporated some mistakes. Nevertheless, Coverdale printed the first complete edition of the English Bible in 1535.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The following October (1536), Tyndale was hanged and then burned at the stake. According to John Foxe, as he was dying, Tyndale cried out in a loud voice, “Lord, open the King of England’s eyes!” Amazingly enough, the king’s eyes were eventually opened, for in 1538 the English Bible was placed in every church in England by royal law. That Bible, called the “Great Bible,” was essentially built off the work of William Tyndale.</article>

    <shortdescription>One of the leading figures of the reformation in Sweden.
</shortdescription>
    <article>Olaf Petri was born on January 6, 1493. During his life as a clergyman, he was a writer and major reformer in Sweden. Olaf completed a master’s degree at the University of Wittenberg in 1518, where he met Martin Luther and Philip Melanchthon. He returned to Sweden in 1519. In October 1524 Olaf and Laurentius were both excommunicated for heresy. However, in 1531 the king proclaimed Sweden to be Lutheran at the Uppsala Council.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Olaf was responsible for the first Swedish New Testament, published in 1526, and also contributed to the first Swedish Bible, which appeared around 1541. Olaf died on April 19, 1552, in Stockholm, Sweden.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>An Anabaptist religious leader contemporary with the Protestant Reformation. His followers became known as Mennonites.
</shortdescription>
    <article>Menno Simons was born about 1496 in a town in northern Holland called Friesland. He became a priest in 1524 but soon began to doubt the doctrine of transubstantiation (that the elements of the Lord’s supper change literally into the body and blood of Christ). As a result, he began reading the Bible for the first time to search for the answers to his questions. He concluded that the Roman teachings were false, but he did not begin speaking openly against the Catholic Church until 1536. It was at this time that he became a traveling preacher of the Anabaptists. By 1554 he was ready to write. He settled down in Holstein, Germany, and worked there in peace until his death in 1561.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Menno Simons was a part of the Anabaptist movement. His followers became known as the Mennonites and are still in existence today.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>German reformer and close friend of Martin Luther. He is known as the first systematic theologian of the Protestant Reformation.
</shortdescription>
    <article>Philip Melanchthon was born in 1497. He was German and studied at Heidelberg and Tubingen Universities. In 1518 he became a professor of Greek at Wittenberg University. Naturally, he was heavily influenced by Martin Luther and quickly joined the ranks of the Protestant Reformation. Melanchthon became Luther’s closest friend, and the two worked tirelessly throughout the Reformation despite some theological differences.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Melanchthon wrote the Augsburg Confession, which remains an important document in Lutheran churches. In 1521 he wrote Commonplaces, his primary theological work. This book underwent several revisions, and the final edition (1555) seemed to stray from Martin Luther’s theology too much. Therefore, after the death of Luther in 1546, Melanchthon received numerous attacks from those who felt he denied the heritage of Luther. He died in 1560.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>French theologian of the Protestant Reformation and the founder of Calvinist theology.
</shortdescription>
    <article>John Calvin was born on July 10, 1509, in northern France. During his life, he attended Paris, Orleans, and Bruges Universities. Between 1532 and 1533, Calvin became associated with the Protestant Reformation. Between 1536 and 1538 he worked in Geneva, Switzerland. As a result of some issues in church governance, Calvin left Geneva for a time, returning in 1541. He remained in Geneva until his death on May 27, 1564.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Calvin was a passionate speaker. In addition to speaking out against the Catholic Church, he wrote against the Anabaptists and the Lutherans. In spite of this, Calvin considered himself to be a follower of Martin Luther and viewed his work as building on Luther’s.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Calvin’s most popular work is called the Instruction in the Christian Religion or Institutes. Although the first edition was published in 1536, the final and definitive edition was completed in 1559 and was five times larger than the original. The Institutes were published to go along with Calvin’s commentaries on Scripture</article>

    <shortdescription>Although Luther did travel to Rome in 1510, the truth behind the various stories is uncertain.
</shortdescription>
    <article>Martin Luther’s journey to Rome is perhaps one of the most confused stories of his life, full of legend and mystery. At different times, even Luther contradicted himself when relating the story to others. In addition, the first two biographers of Luther’s life, Melanchthon and Mathesius, share different stories of Luther’s journey. Unfortunately, the truth of Luther’s journey to Rome will remain a mystery.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Nevertheless, Luther did travel to Rome in 1510, but at this time he was not mature enough in his faith to realize all of the abuses of Rome. It wasn’t until October 31, 1517, that the Ninety-five Theses were made public. Furthermore, it wasn’t until 1519 that Luther began to believe that the pope was the antichrist.</article>

    <shortdescription>A priest and leader of the Protestant Reformation in Scotland. Eventually became the chaplain of king Edward VI of England.
</shortdescription>
    <article>John Knox was born about 1513 near Edinburgh, Scotland. He attended St. Andrews University and became a convert to Protestantism around the age of 30. Knox traveled abroad for about 13 years. In 1553, he fled to the continent to escape the wrath of Queen “Bloody” Mary. As a result, Knox began pastoring a congregation in Frankfurt, Germany. While in Frankfurt, he began to cause controversy by going beyond the Book of Common Prayer. The Book of Common Prayer was compiled by Thomas Cranmer and was considered the official book of service. By introducing teachings not contained in this book, John Knox was considered too radical. Nevertheless, Knox introduced a more reformed worship style, which agitated conservatives. As a result, Knox was expelled from Frankfurt and moved to Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In 1559 John Knox returned to Scotland and continued to help reform the church. While there, he published the Book of Discipline and the Book of Common Order. Knox died in 1572.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>The message to the church of Sardis is to a dead church, perhaps after the beginnings of the Reformation when it found itself falling into orthodoxy. It was dead though it claimed to be alive. A decline in persecution led to a laxness.</shortdescription>
    <article>Sardis is the fifth of seven churches to whom Christ sent a message in Revelation 2 and 3. This is a church with a reputation for being alive, but is dead. No commendation is given by Jesus to Sardis. It is called to be watchful for it is ready to die. The church of Sardis represents a time in church history following the Reformation in the 17th and 18th centuries when many fell into carelessness over spirituality. With the protection of the state and rigid creeds, many were content with a form of godliness but were lacking power. It provides a warning for Christians today to have a genuine experience with Christ.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Beyond Reputation&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Sardis was located about 30 miles southeast of Thyatira. It had a beautiful mountaintop acropolis and was the capital of the ancient kingdom of Lydia, a very important city in the Persian Empire. The city had a reputation for greatness that went beyond reality. When John wrote the Revelation, Sardis fell behind Ephesus and Pergamum in status. The fall of Sardis depicts well this reputation. The self-confident King Croesus  felt completely secure from being conquered by Cyrus of Persia. The city, located on top of Mount Tmolus, provided sheer walls of protection hundreds of feet high. Jesus’ warning of coming like a thief in the night fits the history of Sarids well for Cyrus’ men scaled the wall with the help of a crack in the cliff to attack the unprotected city at night.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Jesus said, “I know your works, that you have a name that you are alive, but you are dead” (Revelation 3:1). The strong rebuke is similar to the scathing denunciations Christ made to the religious leaders of His day. Sardis is told to be “watchful” and “strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die” (v. 2). The church is not totally dead, but on the verge. Jesus says, “I have not found your works perfect before God” (v. 2). The life they lived did not match the words they professed. The remedy is to remember how they first received the gospel and to repent. If the church responds, they will walk with Christ in “white”, which represents purity of life and doctrine. This church may not have its name blotted out of the book of life if it will repent.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The period in church history following the Protestant Reformation is described well by the church of Sardis. It represents the sterility of protestant orthodoxy when the churches settled doctrinal controversy with inflexible creeds.  National churches were established and protected by the government. This was also a time when scientific discoveries made great advances. Rationalism raised questions about the accuracy of Scripture and led many to lay aside doctrinal truth. Human philosophies were mixed with the Bible to make truth more “reasonable”. Spiritual coldness resulted and the churches of this era could be described as truly dead.&lt;BR /&gt;
Turning Around&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The “white” referred to in Jesus’ statement (v. 4) tells us of the purity of His righteousness covering our sins. White is a “pure” color and the church that is dead is defiled by sin. It needs to repent and receive Christ again. Jesus says, “I will not blot out his name from the Book of Life” (v. 5). Sometimes in ancient courts a citizen’s name was erased from the records of a city before the criminal was condemned. In a similar way, we may lose our citizenship in heaven if we do not repent and return to God.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Like ancient Sardis, do we have a reputation for looking good as a Christian, but on the inside we are dead. Do we attend churches that are well respected in the community but have no spiritual life inside? Are the teachings we cling to founded clearly in the word of God or have the philosophies of mankind watered down the truths of the Bible? Jesus says, “Repent. Hold fast to what is good. But watch carefully or you may completely die and have your name removed from the Book of Life. Do not defile your lives by the philosophies of the world. Walk with Me and you will be clothed in My righteousness. I will confess your name before My Father and His angels.” Listen to what the Spirit is saying to the church of Sardis.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>The Ninety-five Theses were posted by Luther on the door of Castle Church in Wittenburg. Known as the impetus for the Protestant Reformation.
</shortdescription>
    <article>On October 31, 1517 (All Saints Day), Martin Luther nailed a copy of his Ninety-five Theses to the door of the Wittenberg church. The Ninety-five Theses dealt primarily with the sale of indulgences, which were documents people could buy to escape purgatory. On the same day, he wrote a letter to the archbishop of Mainz expressing his concerns for the church. He included with the letter a copy of his Ninety-five Theses.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>This debate took place in Leipzig in 1519 and included issues such as free will, grace, indulgences, and papal authority.
</shortdescription>
    <article>The Leipzig Debate began as a result of Luther colleague Karlstadt’s written debates with Johann Eck (a Catholic theologian) over Luther’s Ninety-five Theses. As a result of their dialogue, Luther was brought into the argument. Things continued to escalate until a formal debate was proposed. The Leipzig Debate was held at the University of Leipzig between June 27 and July 16, 1519.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The debates opened with the discussion of free will and the relation of grace and works. Eck was winning the debates before Luther showed up on July 4. When Luther arrived, Eck began a new strategy. He wanted to bring Luther down and attempted to corner him. John Huss was not popular in Leipzig (because of the Hussite wars and his condemnation as a heretic) and Eck was attempting to get Luther to say something that would identify him with Huss. If a link in theology between Luther and Huss could be established, then the citizens of Leipzig would take care of Eck’s problem—Luther. Since John Tetzel had previously associated Luther with John Huss and both reformers spoke out strongly against the papacy, Eck’s tactic of guilt by association was easy.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As a result of the Leipzig Debate, Luther began to realize, perhaps for the first time, that the authority of councils must also be subject to Scripture. Therefore, in this manner, the Leipzig Debate helped Luther truly understand that every earthly authority must be subject to the Word of God.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Johann Eck continued to fight against Luther after the Leipzig Debate and was the man who actually wrote most of Exsurge Domine, the papal bull that threatened Luther with excommunicated.</article>

    <shortdescription>A Papal bull issued by Pope Leo X in June of 1520 to condemn parts of Luther's Ninety-five Theses and threaten him with excommunication unless he recanted.
</shortdescription>
    <article>The papal bull Exsurge Domine (taken from the first two Latin words in the document), which threatened Martin Luther with excommunication, was published in June 1520. In order to avoid excommunication, Luther had 60 days to recant his beliefs. Luther’s response was given on December 10, 1520, 60 days after the bull was delivered to him in Wittenberg. With a crowd of students and faculty, Luther made a speech and then threw the papal bull into a fire and burned it. The Vatican responded on January 3, 1521, through which Luther was formally excommunicated in another papal bull.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>A formal assembly that gathered in Worms, Germany, in 1521 to discuss Luther and his writings.
</shortdescription>
    <article>Many in Europe reacted strongly to Luther’s excommunication. Emperor Charles V was no exception. He did not want Luther to be condemned without a public hearing; therefore, on March 6, 1521, he commissioned Luther to appear before a diet (a legislative assembly) in Worms. Martin Luther’s first appearance before the diet was on April 17, 1521. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The splendor of the atmosphere was initially intimidating and unexpected for Luther. Therefore, when asked to recant his beliefs, he was caught off guard and did not feel prepared to answer the assembly in a just manner. He asked for a day to prepare an answer. On the next day, April 18, Luther bravely told the diet, “My conscience is captive to the Word of God. I cannot, I will not recant anything, for it is neither safe nor right to act against one’s conscience. God help me.”&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Luther left the Diet of Worms in peace, but was abducted by friendly knights and escorted to Wartburg Castle for his own protection. He remained in Wartburg for 10 months and worked on translating the New Testament into German. After completing that task he returned to Wittenberg.</article>

    <shortdescription>Luther published his translation of the New Testament into German in 1522.
</shortdescription>
    <article>During the time that Luther spent in Wartburg Castle, he wrote sermons. But his most important work was translating the New Testament into German. Although it was an extremely difficult task, he completed his translation in just 11 weeks.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Luther brought his New Testament to Wittenberg in March 1522, and Philip Melanchthon proofread the texts for errors. The final product was published in September 1522 and was dedicated to Luther’s protector and friend, Frederick, Duke of Saxony.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>The Zurich debates were a result of Zwingli's preaching in Zurich and his clashes with the bishop of Constance.
</shortdescription>
    <article>The Zurich Disputations began on January 29, 1523, in the Town Hall building. The first of these meetings marked the beginning of the legal Reformation in Zurich. The first debate ended on a positive note. The mayor declared Ulrich Zwingli justified in his Reformation beliefs. Because Zwingli was not viewed as a heretic, the canton of Zurich essentially adopted Ulrich’s teachings. Naturally, Zwingli became more diligent in teaching the people. However, as a result of Zwingli’s teaching against images and icons in the churches, people began defacing public statues and pictures. This questionable act brought the authorities together again to address the issue.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The second disputation occurred in October 1523 and met for two days. More than 800 people were in attendance when Zwingli presented his views to the Council of Zurich. As a result, the council again followed Zwingli’s teaching and voted to remove the images from churches in a peaceful manner. On the second day of this meeting, Zwingli discussed issues regarding the Mass. The Catholics believed that the Mass was a sacrifice, but Zwingli disputed the notion. In his opinion, the Mass should only help people remember Christ’s death on the cross. After the Council of Zurich considered what Zwingli claimed, they accepted it and commissioned people to spread the word to all the people in the canton.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The third disputation continued to deal with issues regarding the Mass, and as a result of a fourth disputation, the Mass was abolished.</article>

    <shortdescription>A reaction in the 16th century against the baptism of infants.
</shortdescription>
    <article>The Anabaptists are considered part of the Radical Reformation; their beliefs were considered more radical than those of Luther’s, Calvin’s, or Zwingli’s. Because the Anabaptist Movement was not perfectly unified, it is nearly impossible to classify their beliefs in a definitive manner. One belief, however, seems to be a common attribute—Anabaptists rejected infant baptism. In fact, the name “Anabaptists” means “re-baptizers.” However, Anabaptists didn’t actually believe in rebaptism, but rather in baptizing adults. They did not consider infant baptism valid, so Anabaptists did not consider this “rebaptism” to be a second baptism.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Some Anabaptists were pacifists, but others likely participated in the Peasants’ War. Some Anabaptists, like Hans Denck or Hans Hut, also rejected the Reformation doctrines of righteousness by faith and Sola Scriptura (the Scriptures only). Nevertheless, the Anabaptists played a vital role within the Reformation and many sects, like the Mennonites and the Amish, remain in communion today.</article>

    <shortdescription>A 16th century series of revolts in Germany due to economic and religious issues. Embraced principles from the Protestant Reformation.
</shortdescription>
    <article>In 1524 and 1525, German and Austrian peasants participated in the Peasants’ Revolt. The rebellion began in the Black Forest area in the summer of 1524. By the next spring, it had penetrated practically every region of Germany. In March 1525, some of the peasant leaders wrote up their beliefs/goals in Twelve Articles. Most of these articles spoke out against economic and social abuses. As a way to justify their grievances, they used the theology of Martin Luther. Although Luther was somewhat sympathetic to the peasants’ concerns, he was against violence and tried to convince them to settle the problem peaceably. However, since the peasant’s would not heed his advice and continued to resort to violence, Luther lashed out strongly against the revolutionaries in May 1525. Around this same time (May 15), the Protestant and Catholic army defeated the peasants at the Battle of Frankenhausen. This did not end the killing. In order to set a precedent, many of the surviving peasants were brutally murdered to ensure that the revolutionaries would never rise again.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As a result of the Peasants’ Revolt, the Protestant Reformation was drastically inhibited. In the case of Luther, he lost confidence that the authority of Scripture alone could rule the people. In a letter written to George Spalatin in January 1527, Luther lamented, “Up to now I have been cherishing the vain hope that men can be directed by the gospel. But the fact is that they destroy the gospel and wish to be constrained by law and sword.” As a result, Luther’s concept of the church remained strikingly similar to the Roman Catholic model, with the pastor essentially fulfilling the same role as the Catholic priest.</article>

    <shortdescription>Martin Luther married Katharina von Bora, a former nun, in 1525.
</shortdescription>
    <article>During the Peasants’ Revolt, Martin Luther married the nun Katherine von Bora. Katherine had fled from the Wittenberg convent about two years prior with a group of “sisters.” The rest of the nuns married quickly, but Katherine refused marriage at first. Luther himself, although previously resistant to marriage, was influenced to marry through his father, who wanted grandchildren to carry on the family name. In the end, Martin and Katherine believed marriage would be a good idea. On June 13, 1525, they were married—Martin at the age of 42 and Katherine 26.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Attack on the city of Rome by mutinous troops, which was blamed on Emperor Charles V.
</shortdescription>
    <article>Although some scholars believe Emperor Charles V was responsible for the sacking of Rome in 1527, this connection cannot be firmly established. Previously, Charles V had been loyal to the papacy, but due to the work of Martin Luther the German Princes were becoming more persuaded toward Protestantism and began resisting the Emperor’s authority. Because of the Protestant sympathies in Germany, Charles V could not find much support from the papacy. The Emperor was fighting to keep his lands together and the pope was trying to keep the Church together. As a result, the relationship between Pope Clement VII and Emperor Charles V was shaky at best.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In any case, Rome was attacked on May 6, 1527, and there was complete chaos for more than a week. During that time, Rome, the “Eternal City,” was ruled by anarchy and barbarism.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Due to the poor relations between the Emperor and the pope, Charles V was blamed for the attack. He quickly absolved himself from any involvement, but Clement VII and Charles V continued to struggle until the popes’ death. However, the new pope, Paul III, took more strides to achieve unity with the emperor.</article>

    <shortdescription>A meeting held at Marburg Castle, Germany, to resolve a disagreement between Luther and Zwingli over the presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper.
</shortdescription>
    <article>The Marburg Colloquy (a colloquy is a formal gathering of theologians who assemble to discuss various theological issue) dealt with the issue of the Lord’s Supper. The main question essentially asked if the presence of Christ was literally in the bread and wine or if it was simply symbolic. The debates took place between a Swiss party and the Wittenberg party and met between October 1 and 4, 1529. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Swiss group included Ulrich Zwingli, Johannes Oecolamadius, Martin Bucer, Wolfgang Capito, and Kasper Sturm. The Wittenberg group included Martin Luther, Philip Melanchthon, Friedrich Myconius, Justus Jonas, Justus Menius, Caspar Creuziger, and George Roerer.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Although the two groups did not come to an agreement at Marburg, they all did sign the Marburg Articles. In the Articles, the two groups found agreement on 14 of 15 points. However, the Swiss continued to believe that the real presence of Christ was not in the bread and wine, and the Wittenberg party believed that it was.</article>

    <shortdescription>A meeting in 1530 in Augsburg, Germany, that attempted to deal with the tensions resulting from Protestant Reformation.
</shortdescription>
    <article>Emperor Charles V called the Diet (a legislative assembly) of Augsburg in 1530. It was his desire to settle the issues over the Lord’s Supper, which the Marburg Colloquy had failed to do the previous year. Although the issues regarding the real presence of Christ in the Lord’s Supper were still not solved, perhaps the greatest achievement of the Diet of Augsburg was the Augsburg Confession, which ironically caused more division. The Augsburg Confession was written by Philip Melanchthon and was approved by Martin Luther.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Augsburg Confession is written in two parts. The first section contains the Lutheran’s primary articles of faith. The second section deals with specific issues, like the Lord’s Supper, the denial of clerical celibacy, and the repudiation of monastic vows. Although the Augsburg Confession is now considered a Lutheran document, Philip Melanchthon continually stressed that those who signed the document were not intending to separate from the Catholic faith. Furthermore, it claimed that it was not creating new doctrines or theologies. In actuality it was very passive. It avoided heavily debated topics such as transubstantiation (that the elements of the Lord’s supper change literally into the body and blood of Christ), purgatory, veneration of the saints, or even the priesthood of all believers. However, one doctrine that was stressed was the Lutheran understanding of justification by faith. Finally, in regards to church unity, the Augsburg Confession stressed the importance of the word (or Gospel rightly preached) and the Sacraments (rightly administered).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In spite of the Augsburg Confession’s supposedly neutral position, by signing the document German princes took a valiant stand against Emperor Charles V (who was trying to reunite his territories with Catholicism). However, the emperor did not accept their insubordination and gave a deadline for them to recant. Civil war was highly probable (between Catholics and Protestants) but the emperor became distracted by foreign affairs. Terms of peace between Catholics and Protestants were eventually drawn up at Nuremberg in 1532 and war was avoided for the time being.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>With the authority given to him by the Act of Supremacy, Henry VIII dissolved all monasteries, convents, priories and friaries in his realm.
</shortdescription>
    <article>The Act of Supremacy declared the King of England (and his successors) to be the absolute head of the Church of England. As a result, in 1536, Henry VIII ordered those monasteries that produced less than 200 pounds a year be dissolved and the property given to the crown. This act caused the only major rebellion of the English Reformation. This revolt became known as the Pilgrimage of Grace, and it was the catalyst to bring about the final blow to the monasteries in England. Henry VIII became enraged at the revolutionaries and forced the larger monasteries to surrender their property to the king. This ceding of property began in 1539.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <article>Christian II was the king of Denmark when the Reformation began. Although he was initially interested in Lutheranism, he quickly rejected it. However, in 1523, he lost his throne to Frederick I.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Some time later, Christian II began trying to regain his throne. Frederick I died in 1533, but political unrest continued. Civil war followed for three years in Denmark, and Christian III was eventually victorious. Christian III, unlike Christian II, was committed to Lutheranism and declared the country Lutheran in 1536. When Christian III was crowned king in 1537, a Lutheran pastor placed the royal crown on the king’s head.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Also known as the Cranmer Bible, the first authorized Bible in English to be read aloud during church service.
</shortdescription>
    <article>The translation work of this Bible was overseen by Miles Coverdale and was essentially a revised version of the “Matthew Bible,” which was the work of John Rogers. The Matthew Bible was the best compilation of the translations by William Tyndale.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
During the process and preparation of the Great Bible, Thomas Cromwell supported Coverdale. And in September 1538, Cromwell declared on behalf of the king that every church in England should have an English Bible.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Reaffirmed Catholic doctrine on six issue, including transubstantiation, celibacy, and private masses.
</shortdescription>
    <article>The English Parliament passed the Act of Six Articles in 1539 during the reign of King Henry VIII. The document was very dogmatic. People who did not believe in transubstantiation (that the elements of the Lord’s supper change literally into the body and blood of Christ) were rewarded with the death penalty and the Crown confiscated their property. In fact, these people did not even have the option of recanting. The Six Articles also reaffirmed Catholic doctrine on five other issues: withholding the cup from the laity during communion, clerical celibacy, vows of chastity, private Masses, and auricular confession.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Founded by Ignatius in 1540 as a male religious order under the Roman Catholic Church.
</shortdescription>
    <article>Ignatius of Loyola organized the Jesuits, or the Society of Jesus, in 1540.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Ignatius had an experience similar to that of Martin Luther. He was completely distressed over his sins and struggled tremendously. Luther eventually discovered the meaning of righteousness by faith and found solace in Scripture. Ignatius, on the other hand, created a method based upon human achievement through spiritual exercise. His book Spiritual Exercises (based on salvation by works) became very popular and helped to guide the Catholic Church during the Counter-Reformation (the Catholic response to the Protestant Reformation).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Ignatius gathered a small group of men who shared his ideals, and the group began spreading their “reform” message. In the summer of 1539, Ignatius presented his ideas to Pope Paul III and, in September 1540, the pope issued a bull that put the Society of Jesus in official standing within the Catholic Church.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
An elitist society, the Jesuits were incredibly disciplined. The initiation process to become a member took 12 years, which were full of rigorous studies, both in philosophy and theology. Despite the intensity of training, the Jesuit Order was extremely popular and by 1556 (the year Ignatius died) the Order had more than 900 members. Eventually the Order grew to about 30,000 and continued to maintain that number for decades.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Jesuits committed much of their time and energy to eradicating Protestantism and attempting to restore Catholicism to Europe. However, their elitist attitude, extremist mentality, and eventually financial collapse brought the Society of Jesus to an end for a time. In 1773 Pope Clement XIV officially ended the Jesuit Order. However, the Society of Jesus did not completely pass away and was revitalized in 1814 by Pope Pius VII and continues to this day.</article>

    <shortdescription>A conference held in Regensburg in an attempt to restore religious unity through theological debates.
</shortdescription>
    <article>The Diet (a legislative assembly) of Regensburg, which met in 1541, was primarily concerned with restoring unity within Christian theology. Although the theologians present, both Catholic and Protestant, did not agree on everything (specifically the concept of transubstantiation), they did find agreement in one area. The participants of the colloquy (a formal gathering of theologians who assemble to discuss various theological issue) actually managed to come to an “agreement” on the concept of justification. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The essential consensus stated that justification was imputed to the believer because of Christ’s righteousness; however, once justified, the converted life would be led to do righteous deeds. In actuality, this agreeable statement was simply ambiguous for both Catholics and Protestants to agree upon, and didn’t accurately reflect either Catholic or Lutheran beliefs regarding justification. Nevertheless, because Catholics and Protestants actually agreed on something in a time of much disagreement, this diet is considered quite important.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Consisted of four ordinances: pastors to preach, doctors to instruct believers, elders to discipline, and deacons to care for the poor.
</shortdescription>
    <article>John Calvin was welcomed back to Geneva, Switzerland, in 1541. In less than two months time, he managed to enact his Ecclesiastical Ordinances. These ordinances were essentially designed to bring about “pure discipline.” In this sense, Geneva was to be considered the true Christian city. Within this new discipline, there were four positions to be held in the church. The first office held the highest authority, which was the pastor. Next came the elder, then the deacon, and finally the doctor (or teacher). The pastor and elder were responsible for maintaining church discipline, while the deacon and the doctor served the church in other various capacities.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Ecclesiastical Ordinances were incredibly strict. The pastors and elders met weekly (every Thursday) to administer church discipline. This group, known as the Consistory, had the power to excommunicate and hand the rejected person(s) over to the secular authorities to be punished.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Consisted of tribunals held by the the Roman Catholic Church to prosecute crimes against church doctrine.
</shortdescription>
    <article>Since the time of Emperor Constantine (c. 313), papal authorities often acted as inquisitors, bringing punishment to people or groups that offended the Catholic Church. In the late 1400s, the Spanish Inquisition was launched primarily against the Jewish people. However, during the Catholic Counter-Reformation, the Inquisition reached its zenith in its attempt to eradicate Protestantism.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In 1542 Pope Paul III revived the Inquisition in Italy and based it upon the Spanish model (used previously during the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella). The Roman Inquisition began with the establishment of the Congregation of the Holy Office. Within this organization, the position of the Inquisitor-General held the authority to stamp out heresy by whatever means necessary.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In 1908 the Congregation of the Holy Office was renamed the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office. In 1965, as a result of Vatican II, the name changed again to the Congregation of the Doctrine of Faith. However, the primary objective of that office has never changed—to maintain/protect Catholic orthodoxy.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Convened to issue condemnations against Protestant heresies and to reassert and define church teachings.
</shortdescription>
    <article>The Council of Trent began on December 13, 1545, and ended on December 4, 1563. The council consisted of 25 different sessions and involved three different popes: Paul III (1534–1549), Julius III (1550–1555), and Pius IV (1559–1565).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Council of Trent set the precedents of the Catholic Church, which remained until the church was reinterpreted at the Vatican II Council (1962–1965).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In essence, the Council of Trent sought to distinguish the Roman Catholic Church from all Protestant denominations. Therefore, it was extremely anti-Protestant and portrayed the Roman Catholic Church as the only true church: the “One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic” church of God.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Early in the council, the doctrine of Sola Scriptura (the Bible only) was rejected and tradition and Scripture were considered equal in theory. The council did not define this relationship between tradition and Scripture; therefore, tradition usually held a primacy over Scripture in actual practice. The council also pronounced the Latin Vulgate (not written in a common language) to be the official and only true Scriptures. It further condemned those who attempted to interpret Scripture in any way that contradicted the Roman Catholic Church.</article>

The Counter-Reformation is illustrated best by the ecclesiastical reforms of the Council of Trent, the revival of the Inquisition, the appearance of the Index of Prohibited Books, and the work of the Jesuits.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <article>Edward VI became king on January 28, 1547; he was only nine years old. Because of his young age, his coronation was modeled after that of Josiah in the Old Testament. Edward VI was tutored by Protestant teachers and read his Bible every day. During his reign, various reforms were brought about through the influence of Thomas Cranmer and others.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
King Edward VI’s reign was very brief. He died July 6, 1553, at the age of 15 and was succeeded by Queen Mary I, also known as “Bloody Mary.” Queen Mary devoted her reign to the restoration of Catholicism, which significantly stunted the English Reformation.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <article>Mary I is perhaps more commonly known as “Bloody Mary,” an epithet she received as a result of her numerous executions of Protestant believers. This reign of terror began to unfold on February 4, 1555, when John Rogers, a Protestant who had assisted in creating an English Bible, was burned alive. Rogers was merely the first of about 300 who would die at the hand of Bloody Mary over the next three years. Anne Boleyn came to power when Mary died on November 17, 1558, and took the name of Queen Elizabeth I (1558–1603).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>An agreement that guaranteed Protestants and Catholics equal security in the divided Hapsburg Empire.
</shortdescription>
    <article>As a result of the Protestant Reformation, Europe was literally being ripped apart. Disunity and chaos seemed to abound, and order and authority were severely lacking. In April 1546 Emperor Charles V (loyal to Catholicism) attacked the German princes (loyal to Protestantism). Because the princes had been divided in leadership, they were not prepared to retaliate sufficiently. Two years later Charles V won a decisive victory at the Battle of Mühlberg. As a result, he reinstated Catholicism in Germany—known as the Augsburg Interim.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
However, the Augsburg Interim could not be enforced because the people on the continent demanded religious liberty. Charles V continued to try to fight and regain control of his Empire, but lost much of his support. He eventually gave up, largely due to health problems, and lived the rest of his days in a Spanish monastery. After his retirement, the Hapsburg Empire was divided. The Emperor’s son, Philip, took control of Spain, Burgundy, and parts of Italy, and Charles V’s brother, Ferdinand, took Germany and the eastern regions.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In order to establish peace, religious concessions were necessary. The Peace of Augsburg was created in 1555 to fulfill that purpose. As a result, Protestants that accepted the Augsburg Confession were promised equal security and rights with the Catholics in those regions.</article>

    <shortdescription>Began in 1559 to teach students Protestant doctrines as understood by John Calvin. Eventually evolved into the University of Geneva, which is still active today.
</shortdescription>
    <article>The Geneva Academy was established as a learning center to educate people in the way that John Calvin considered best. It opened on June 5, 1559, and Theodore Beza was its first rector.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Geneva Academy was very prosperous in its early years and played a critical role in spreading the Calvinist message to other countries. The vast majority of students at the academy were from countries other than Switzerland, although at first, mostly from France. The men that came to study at this institution went back to their homes and spread Calvinist doctrines. Calvin died five years after the academy was opened, but it continued to grow. Over time, the Geneva Academy developed into the University of Geneva, which remains in Switzerland today.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>An official list of books that the Catholic Church considered heretical. Catholics were forbidden to read any book on the list until 1966.
</shortdescription>
    <article>Prior to the Index of Prohibited Books, there were many books that were forbidden and even burned (including Bibles) by the Catholic Church. When Pope Paul IV wrote the first draft of the Index in 1559, it was a direct defense against Protestantism. In 1564 Pope Pius IV published an updated Index. The next pope, Pius V (1566–1572), established the Congregation of the Index, which continued to review books that were published. As new books hit the market, the Index of Prohibited Books continued to grow.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
When the Index was first published, it included books by the prominent Reformers: Luther, Zwingli, Calvin, Erasmus, etc. The final edition (the 20th) of the Index was published in 1948 under the reign of Pope Pius XII (1939–1958). Pope Paul VI finally abolished the Index of Prohibited Books in 1966 shortly after Vatican II (1962–1965).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Opposed the predestination doctrines of John Calvin, giving rise to Arminianism.
</shortdescription>
    <article>Jacobus Arminius was a Dutchman born on October 10, 1560. He studied theology in Geneva under Theodore Beza, who was the first rector of the Geneva Academy. In 1603 Arminius became a professor of theology at the University of Leiden. He was a popular professor but quickly came into conflict with Franciscus Gomarus, who disagreed with Jacobus on predestination. Gomarus, like John Calvin, believed that God had elected beforehand those to be saved and those to be lost. However, according to Arminius, humans were saved according to their response to God, not according to God’s divine election. Arminius rejection of predestination began to cause division within the Calvinist churches.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Arminius died in 1609. However, just prior to his death, he called for a synod to revise the Belgic Confession. By the time of the Synod of Dort in 1618, extreme opposition had formed. On one side, the Remonstrants (or Arminians) took a stand against predestination, and on the other side, the Counter-Remonstrants (or Calvinists) strongly advocated it. According to Counter-Remonstrantist arguments, they believed the Arminians (or Remonstrants) were returning to Catholicism because Remonstrants believed humans had a role in their own salvation. Therefore, as the Synod of Dort progressed, the Remonstrant leaders were ejected from the council and the Canons of Dordrecht proclaimed the Calvinist faith in opposition to Arminianism.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Prior to Arminius, groups like the Anabaptists and Waldensians held similar views concerning the free will of mankind. Moreover, other Christian denominations have grown out of the faith traditions started by Arminius. Some of these denominations include the Baptists, Methodists, and Seventh-day Adventists.</article>

    <shortdescription>Wars between Catholics and Huguenots over their differing faiths. Although intermittent, they lasted for more than three decades.
</shortdescription>
    <article>As Protestant churches continued to organize and pastors continued to return from Geneva Academy, the religious background of France began to drastically change.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Between 1550 and 1565, about 1,200 Protestant churches had been formed, which served approximately two million believers. These Protestants, known as Huguenots, were a significant threat to Catholicism in France. Violent outbreaks began to occur in 1562; when the Duke of Guise, a Catholic, was assassinated in March 1563, religious peace was shattered. War between the Catholics and Huguenots continued for more than 30 years in intermittent fashion.&lt;BR /&gt;

He had accepted the Reformed faith (Calvinism) in 1561 and ejected all of the Lutheran ministers from his territory. Calvinist ministers were brought in to replace them, and two of them, Kaspar Olevianus and Zacharias Ursinus, wrote the Heidelberg Catechism in 1563. This work became one of the Reformed Catechisms that remains authoritative today.</article>

    <shortdescription>Pope Pius V excommunicated Elizabeth I in attempt to cause the English people to usurp her power and restore England to the Catholic faith.
</shortdescription>
    <article>After the reign of Bloody Mary, Elizabeth I ended the fierce persecutions of Protestants. Instead of chastising the queen for her less than ardent Catholic faith, the Vatican hoped to win back England through the art of diplomacy. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
For about 10 years, nothing seemed to be moving forward, so Pope Pius V resorted to more drastic measures. In 1569 a rebellion broke out in the north. In hopes that the queen’s people would overthrow the Crown, the pope excommunicated Elizabeth I. However, the rebellion had already been quelled by the time Regnans in Excelsis, a papal bull, arrived in England.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As a result, Elizabeth began to hunt down Catholic priests living in England and execute them for treason. During her reign, more than 200 Catholic priests were killed.&lt;BR /&gt;

</shortdescription>
    <article>During the French Reformation, there were intermittent wars between the Huguenots and the Catholics. During a relative time of peace, a great massacre began in Paris.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The killing started on August 23, 1572, (St. Bartholomew’s Day) when many Huguenot leaders were killed in their beds or murdered as they tried to escape. The bloodthirsty mobs continued to move throughout Paris, killing anyone in their path over a three-day period. The violence eventually spread to other cities, and thousands more were slaughtered. About 20,000 people were killed during the massacre and, apparently, the River Rhone turned blood red with numerous corpses floating downstream.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>A Dutch Reformed Synod that began in opposition to Arminianism.
</shortdescription>
    <article>The Dutch Reformed Church convened the Synod of Dort in order to address the problems of Arminianism. The meetings began on November 13, 1618, and ended on May 9, 1619. As a result, the Canons of Dordrecht were presented and later added to the Heidelberg Catechism.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In English, the Canons of Dordrecht form a five-point acronym—TULIP. T = total depravity; U = unconditional election; L = limited atonement; I = irresistible grace; P = perseverance of the saints. This acronym adequately describes the Reformed or Calvinistic concept of double predestination (that some are predestined to be saved, others to be lost). Essentially, man is completely tainted with sin (total depravity), God literally chooses who will be saved and lost regardless of works (unconditional election), Christ died only to save the elect (limited atonement), it is impossible for the elect to resist the grace of God (irresistible grace), and no elected or “true” Christian can ever be lost (perseverance of the saints).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>A war in Europe between Protestant and Catholic forces, lasting from 1618 to 1648.
</shortdescription>
    <article>In 1617 Ferdinand of Styria was elected king of Bohemia (essentially modern-day Czech Republic). At this time, Bohemia was Protestant, but the Jesuits had educated the new king. The Protestants reacted against his election on May 23, 1618, when they marched to the royal palace in Prague and threw members of the king’s staff out of the windows (a 50-foot fall). This brought about the beginning of the Thirty Year’s War.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Protestant forces quickly organized and eradicated all of the Jesuits from Bohemia and confiscated various Catholic properties. They also rejected Ferdinand of Styria as their king and elected Frederick V in his stead. However, in 1620, less than a year after his election, Frederick V lost a major battle at White Mountain and was deposed as king.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Battle of White Mountain could have ended the war, but numerous mercenaries had vested interests in the ongoing struggle. This prolonged the war until 1625, when the Danish (Protestant) king, Christian IV (1588–1648), got involved in the conflict. However, Christian IV suffered a devastating defeat at the Battle of Lutter in 1626. As a result of this tremendous victory for Catholic forces, the Edict of Restitution was passed. This edict required Lutherans to return Church properties and turned the followers of John Calvin into outlaws. Various cities were also forced to accept the Catholic faith again upon pain of death.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Just as the emperor was about to reinstate Catholicism throughout the European lands, the Swedish came to the rescue. Gustavus Adolphus (1594–1632) was the Protestant king of Sweden and a fantastic military strategist. In 1631 he led the Protestants to victory at the Battle of Breitenfield. However, Adolphus was killed the next year in the Battle of Lutzen (1532).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Eventually, the French joined with the Swedish Protestants and the war lingered on for another 13 years. The Treaty of Westphalia finally ended the war in 1648. There was no real winner between the Catholic and Protestant forces. Rather, the Treaty of Westphalia promoted the idea of religious toleration. As a result, Catholicism, Calvinism, and Lutheranism were all legally recognized religions in their respected areas.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>An English Bible teacher imprisoned for preaching without a license. Author of Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinner and Pilgrim's Progress.
</shortdescription>
    <article>John Bunyan was born to a poor English family on November 28, 1628. Between 1644 and 1647, during the English Civil War, Bunyan served in the Parliamentary army. In 1649, he married. As a result of his wife’s influence, Bunyan began seeking God. In 1653 he became a member of the St. John’s Church in Bedford. With time, he began to preach. Although uneducated, Bunyan gained supporters, such as John Owen, an administrator at Oxford University who admired Bunyan’s knowledge of the English Bible.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In 1660 Charles II returned to power and Anglican laws were reestablished. That same year, Bunyan was thrown into prison for preaching without a license. He remained in prison until 1672 because he refused to quit preaching. In 1677 he returned to prison for a brief period for the same crime.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
While Bunyan was in prison, his time was put to good use. He wrote two of his most popular books, Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners, an autobiography, and Pilgrim’s Progress, the famous allegorical tale of Christian on a journey to the Celestial City.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The first part of Pilgrim’s Progress (the story of Christian) was published in 1678, and the second part (the story of Christiana) was published in 1684. It wasn’t until 1728, after Bunyan’s death in 1688, that the two stories were combined into a single bound volume. This masterful work by Bunyan has never been out of print and has been translated into more than 100 languages.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
John Bunyan other books include The Life and Death of Mr. Badman (1680), The Holy War (1682), and The Work of Jesus Christ as an Advocate (1688).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Began in 1642 and ended in 1651. The battles were primarily fought between King Charles I and the Parliamentary Army.
</shortdescription>
    <article>Scholars disagree as to who is responsible for beginning the English Civil War, but King Charles I (1625–1649) is at least partially to blame. Charles I was very insensitive toward the Puritans in England. However, the Puritans were not without support. There were many members of Parliament who were either Puritan or respected the Puritan faith.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In 1637 the Scottish war began, a rebellion against Charles I. The Scots eventually began to invade England, which forced Charles I to turn to Parliament for assistance. For a few years, matters continued to escalate in England. Eventually, in June 1642, the Parliament passed the Nineteen Propositions, which severely limited the authority of the king. As a result, Charles I refused to accept the document. The king’s response began the unexpected English Civil War.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The war ended on September 3, 1651, at the Battle of Worcester. Just prior to this in 1649, King Charles I had been beheaded by an army led by Puritan leader Oliver Cromwell.</article>

    <shortdescription>Effectively ended the Thirty Years' War by advocating religious toleration.
</shortdescription>
    <article>The Treaty of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years’ War in 1648. There was no real winner between the Catholic and Protestant forces. Rather, the Treaty of Westphalia promoted the idea of religious toleration. As a result, Catholicism, Calvinism, and Lutheranism were all legally recognized religions in their respected areas.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>The message to the church of Philadelphia is one that represents the advancement of the gospel in the 19th century when the church was small but growing. It represents the church of the great second advent awakening.</shortdescription>
    <article>Philadelphia is the sixth of seven churches to which Christ sent special messages in the book of Revelation. The name for this city means “brotherly love” and describes a church that receives no condemnation, only encouragement. For people who were probably cast out of their local Jewish synagogues for being Christians, Jesus gives assurance of their security in the temple above. The period of church history described by Philadelphia fits the missionary movements of the 19th century when a passion to spread the gospel created a bond of love among those anticipating Christ’s soon return.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Brotherly Love&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love, was located about 25 miles southeast of Sardis in Asia Minor. It was founded in 138 B.C. and destroyed by an earthquake in A.D. 17. Tiberius, the Roman emperor, rebuilt the city. Because of its beauty, ancient writers referred to the new city as “Little Athens.” The fact that John’s letter from Patmos contains no rebuke indicates the beautiful spirit of this church. Even today, the city, now called Alashehir, is known for its kind people.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Christ is described as “holy and true” to this faithful church. Jesus is divine and genuine. He is described as “He who has the key of David, He who opens and no one shuts, and shuts and no one opens” (Revelation 3:7). This picture emphasizes the eminence of Christ as controlling the gates of heaven and the temple of God. If the “synagogue of Satan” (v. 9) speaks of those who cast Christians out, then the message of assurance given to this church is appropriate. “You may have been cast out on earth, but you are not cast out in heaven.” Jesus even says these persecutors will someday “worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you” (v. 9).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It is especially meaningful that overcomers are told “I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall go out no more” (v. 12). The central and most important place in the universe is God’s throne room. To be assured of continual access to God, never to “go out” (or be cast out) gives these believers a sense of how much the Lord desires them to be close. Furthermore there are three references to “writing” of God’s city, God’s name, and a new name. What greater mark of acceptance could Jesus give His precious servants than to clearly identify them as His own.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;A Missionary Fervor&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
The great missionary movement of the last part of the 18th century and the early part of the 19th century is captured by the church of Philadelphia. The advancement of the gospel during this time shows a church faithful to its calling. These evangelical movements in Europe and the United States stressed practical godliness and revived people’s faith in preparing for Christ’s coming. Such fervor had not existed since the early days of the Reformation.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
There is a deeper application of the “shut door” and “open door” language for this period of church history. When we study the great illustration of salvation found in the sanctuary, we see two phases of work: the daily service for ministering to individuals seeking cleansing from sin and the yearly service (Day of Atonement) which was a day of judgment. The daily service was tied to the holy place and the yearly to the most holy place. Students of Bible prophecy have discovered that a change of Christ’s work in the heavenly sanctuary took place in 1844 A.D. (see the prophecy of Daniel 8:14). Just as Christ entered the most holy place upon His ascension to heaven, so now our High Priest has “closed” the door of work in one compartment and “opened” a door into the most holy. The language to the Philadelphia church speaks of this special transition which prepares us for Jesus’ soon coming.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Churches today need to regain the missionary fervor of spreading the gospel in light of the Second Advent. Individual Christians who seek truth wherever it leads, even if they are cast out of their churches, will continue to follow Jesus with the assurance that a door is held open by a loving hand. Christ says, “Behold, I am coming quickly! Hold fast what you have, that no one may take your crown” (v. 11). When we are patient and persevering, just as Christ was while on earth, we can be assured of a place in God’s heavenly temple where we will never be cast out.</article>

    <shortdescription>One of the signs of Christ's coming after the tribulation (see the 1260 year prophecy) is great earthquakes. One of the greatest earthquakes in modern times took place in Lisbon, Portugal on November 1, 1755 causing massive destruction and death.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jesus predicted that one of the signs of His soon coming in the natural world would be “earthquakes in various places” (Matthew 24:7). One of the most powerful earthquakes to strike our planet in these last days happened in Lisbon, Portugal, on November 1, 1755. It impacted not only Europe and Africa, but was also felt all the way into America, covering an area of approximately four million square miles. In just a few minutes, this massive quake leveled public and private buildings (some say 85 percent) causing the deaths of up to 100,000 people. Many have called it one of the deadliest earthquakes in history. Certainly more massive earthquakes will happen before Christ comes, but many Bible scholars see this particular quake as a sign that awakened the world to the fact that we had entered the time of the end.</article>

    <shortdescription>The beast that "rises from the earth" comes out of a place that is not populous. This second beast fits the description of the rise of the United States of America, which grew in power when the first beast went into captivity.</shortdescription>
    <article>In Revelation 13 another beast rises from the earth. That is, another in addition to the one already mentioned (v. 1). The Greek implies that it is of the same kind as the first beast. This is confirmed as its characteristics are unfolded. It works in close collaboration with the first beast. It comes up "out of the earth." The prophet sees the action as going on. The first beast arose out of the sea (see on v. 1). The four beasts of Dan. 7 also arose from the sea (v. 3). Since “sea” represents peoples and nations (see on Rev. 13:1 17:1, 2, 8), “earth” may reasonably be assumed to represent a sparsely settled region. The nation thus represented would therefore not arise by war, conquest, and occupation, but would develop into greatness in a region of few inhabitants.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Many commentators have seen in this second beast a symbol of the United States of America. This power accurately fulfills the specifications of the prophecy. When the first beast was going into captivity in 1798 (see on ch. 13:10) the United States was growing into prominence and power. The nation arose, not in the Old World, with its teeming multitudes, but in the New World, with its relatively few inhabitants.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It had two horns. These may be taken to represent the two notable features of the American system of government, civil and religious liberty, both of which are guaranteed in the Constitution of the United States. Civil liberty found its expression in a republican form of government and religious liberty in Protestantism.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
A lamb. A symbol of youthfulness and peaceful intent. Other nations have been described as wild beasts because of their warlike attitudes. This beast with the horns of a lamb could well indicate a nation that, in the beginning of its history, had no such aspirations. Its main concern was to live peacefully, order its own affairs, and be a haven of rest for the oppressed of many nations.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It spake like the dragon. Textual evidence may be cited (cf. p. 10) for the reading “is speaking.” This tense agrees with that of the following verses, which describe the activities of the beast during the period when it speaks like a dragon. The narrative of its exploits is told in the dramatic present tense. There is a striking contradiction between the appearance and actions of the beast. In appearance it is gentle and apparently harmless, but in action it is persecuting and cruel, as vs. 12–18 reveal. When the prophecy is applied to the United States it is immediately apparent that fulfillment of the prediction is future. The United States today continues to maintain the principles of freedom guaranteed in the Constitution. The manner in which a change in policy will be brought about is outlined in the present prophecy. The change comes in connection with the final crisis immediately preceding the time when “the kingdoms of this world … become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ”.</article>

    <shortdescription>The Bible predicted that at the end of the tribulation (see the 1260 day prophecy) there would be signs in the heavens, the sun would be darkened and the moon would appear as red as blood. On May 19, 1780 these signs appeared in Northeast America.</shortdescription>
    <article>One of the signs of Christ’s soon coming mentioned in Matthew 24:29 is, “Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light.” The tribulation that Jesus pointed to ended after the 1,260 years of persecution in the year 1798. This prophecy finds fulfillment in an event historians call “New England’s Dark Day.” On May 19, 1780, an unusual darkness settled over the northeastern part of the North American continent. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It became so dark at mid-morning that candles were lit, birds fell silent, and chickens retired to roost. People could not read the newspaper by daylight. When the moon arose that night, it was not immediately visible. When it finally appeared, it was blood red. John the Revelator adds these prophetic words to this event, “And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became like blood” (Revelation 6:12). These two witnesses, the sun and moon, pointed to the time of the end and that Christ will soon return.</article>

    <shortdescription>The Revelation 13:3 prophecy that the beast’s head would appear to be “mortally wounded” saw its fulfillment in 1798, when the French army entered Rome and took Pope Pius VI captive. It was subsequently healed with the reestablishment of the papacy i</shortdescription>
    <article>In Revelation 13:3, the Bible predicts that the beast, the papacy, would appear to lose its power completely and then, subsequently, would regain that power so that all the world would wonder after it. Napoleon’s French army, led by Louis-Alexandre Berthier, entered Rome and ended the papacy’s 1,260-year political reign by taking Pope Pius VI, the “head” of the church of Rome, as a prisoner to France in February 1798. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
However, that wound was healed in the year 1929 when Mussolini executed the Concordat of 1929 with Pope Pius XI, restoring the properties and powers that had been taken away from the church in 1798. At that time, Vatican City was set up as a sovereign political power. Today, the restoration and influence of the papacy, with more than a billion followers, in world affairs is attested to by the fact that most of the countries of the world have political representatives at Vatican City.</article>

    <shortdescription>One of the signs of Christ's return is that the "stars would fall from heaven." On November 13, 1833 one of the most spectacular meteor showers ever took place in America when thousands of meteors appeared per hour in the sky.</shortdescription>
    <article>Jesus stated in Matthew 24:29 that one of the signs of His soon return was that “the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.” John also wrote of events after the sixth seal was opened, “And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree drops its late figs when it is shaken by a mighty wind” (Revelation 6:13). The most famous meteor shower of this time period in history (“after the tribulation of those days” in Matthew 24:29) took place on November 13, 1833. It has been described as “spectacular” and of “superlative strength.” &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
While some amazing meteor showers have counted 1,000 to 2,000 meteors per hour, this event recorded up to 100,000 meteors per hour. One eyewitness wrote, “There was scarcely a space in the firmament which was not filled at every instant with these falling stars.” Jesus gave these signs as a witness in the heavens of His soon return.</article>

    <shortdescription>The last message to the church of Laodicea represents the church in the last days up until the time of Christ's second coming. It is a message of warning to a church that feels rich, but is poor. The church is lukewarm and needs to awaken.</shortdescription>
    <article>The last message to the seven churches of Revelation 2 and 3 is given to the church of Laodicea. The name of this church means “a people judged.” The sharpest rebuke is given to the final church. It is lukewarm and blind to its own needs. Christ is ready to spit this church out of His mouth. But a message of counsel shows His love for a self-deceived people. Jesus offers the very things this church thinks it does not need. He patiently knocks at the door of this church seeking to enter. To the overcomers of Laodicea, the greatest of all promises is given, to sit with Jesus on His throne. Laodicea perfectly represents the laziness and self-sufficiency of the church at the end of time.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;A Self-deceived Church&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Laodicea was a wealthy city in Asia Minor located about 45 miles southeast of Philadelphia. Unlike the nearby cities of Heirapolis (known for its hot springs) or Collasae (known for its fresh cold water), this city had to pipe water in. By the time it arrived it was lukewarm and distasteful. Jesus described the works of this church as neither hot nor cold. “Because you are lukewarm… I will vomit you out of My mouth” (Revelation 3:16). God detests mediocrity because even a cold church has opportunity to recognize its serious condition.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
“You do not know…” marks Laodicea. This church felt it was rich and needed nothing. Actually, it was a prominent banking center known for its self-sufficiency. When it was destroyed by an earthquake, it refused assistance from the emperor to rebuild. Laodicea was also famous for its woolen black cloth and a first-century medical school that specialized in eye ointment. To this wealthy church Jesus said, “You do not know that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked” (v. 17). This is quite strong language for a proud city.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Though wealthy, Christ offers them gold refined in fire (the pure gold of faith). Though famous for its textile business, Jesus calls them “naked” and offers them the white garments of His righteousness. Though known for a medical school that sold a special eye ointment, the Lord says they are “blind” and need His eye salve to see. Jesus loves this church. “As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Therefore be zealous and repent” (v. 19). The root word for zealous (zest) means “hot.” The Lord wants this church to be on fire and offers help. But God doesn’t force Himself on Laodicea. “Behold I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in…” (v. 20).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;The Ultimate Promise&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
The promises to the seven churches have slowly been building in number. One might expect the number of promises to be the highest for the last church, but it is only given one. Yet, it exceeds all others. “To him who overcomes I will grant to sit with Me on My throne…” (v. 21). It is a promise that consumes all promises. Sitting with Christ on His throne means you have everything you could ever want or need.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Many churches today are in a near-hopeless condition, not because there is no hope, but because they do not recognize the seriousness of their need. In an age of prosperity and materialism, the church can look around her and count big financial offerings, large numbers of members, numerous institutions raised, houses of worship around the world, and all the good works it has accomplished since its inception. It can sit back and feel it has arrived. But a church that rests on her own laurels is a church that is poor, blind, and naked. Never can the church rely on her own works to secure salvation. No condition can be worse than a state of self-denial for this church feels no need to wake up. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Though the sharpest of all messages is given to Laodicea, it is not a church without hope. Jesus cares deeply about this last church represented by the time before His second coming. It is a judgment hour church in which the final events of earth’s history will be culminated. His wake-up call is combined with a loving and persistent knocking. Jesus desires to commune with Laodicea and lift her up to sit with Him on His heavenly throne. Her material wealth and grand accomplishments are no match for the righteousness of Christ which no amount of money can ever buy.</article>

    <shortdescription>The three angel's messages of Revelation 14 are end-time messages that are to be given before Christ comes. The proclamation of these messages began in 1844 and will continue until Christ comes.</shortdescription>
    <article>Three angels in Revelation 14:6-11 symbolize the proclamation of end time messages that God’s remnant people are to give to the world in preparation for Christ’s imminent return. Whereas Revelation 13 shows the dragon’s work in the final events, Revelation 14 shows the work of God’s people before Jesus comes back. This remnant church, spoken of in 18:1-4 are commissioned to “prophesy again” after a bitter time of disappointment (see 10:11). Though angels assist in the work of helping mankind spread the gospel, it is the work of the final church to preach salvation to the whole world (see Matthew 28:18-20). The three angels depict God’s people who will proclaim a final message to everyone on the earth.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;The First Angel&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
The essence of the message of the first angel is the “everlasting gospel” (Revelation 14:6). It is to be preached to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people. It is a universal message to be proclaimed with a “loud voice” (v. 7). Three parts are outlined in this communication. The first is, “Fear God and give glory to Him”. Fearing God means to reverence the Lord. One way to glorify God is by caring for our bodies (see 1 Corinthians 10:31). The second part says, “…for the hour of His judgment has come”. When the 2300 day prophecy of Daniel 8:14 met its completion in 1844 A.D. the first angel’s message was being proclaimed. The third part reads, “…and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water”. Here is a clear reference to the fourth commandment which declares the seventh-day Sabbath as a memorial of creation. God’s final warning to the world is to worship and obey His commandments. This stands in sharp contrast with the beast and the dragon who seek the worship and obedience of all mankind.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;The Second Angel&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
“Babylon is fallen” symbolizes the message of the second angel. Babylon has its origins in Genesis 11 when mankind disobeyed God and sought to build a tower to save themselves. Babel (related to Babylon) means confusion. The Israelites were later taken to the city of Babylon, but in John’s day the “great city” lay in ruins. Babylon represents a power that defies God and oppresses the Lord’s people. Its counterpart is Jerusalem, which stands for God’s kingdom. The empire of Rome was referred to as Babylon (see 1 Peter 5:13) and this power grew during the Middle Ages to manifest itself in the papal power that stood in opposition to God. She “made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication” (Revelation 14:8). This false church pushes her counterfeit teachings to “all nations.” Fornication shows her unfaithfulness to God by connecting church with state (see 17:5).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;The Third Angel&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
The most fearful and solemn warning in the Bible is found in the message of the third angel. The first angel proclaims the gospel and calls people to worship God as Creator because the judgment time has come. The second angel warns against forms of worship created by mankind. Now with more intensity another warning is given to those who worship the beast and his image. Turning from the gospel ultimately leads to following the false teachings of the beast. Revelation 13:5 describes this church and state union that persecutes God’s people for 1260 years. Only two groups will exist in the final days: those who worship God and those who worship the beast. People who reject God as Creator (and His day of worship, the seventh-day Sabbath that shows His Lordship over all creation) will receive the mark of the beast.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Followers of the beast shall “drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation” (14:10). In God’s righteous judgment, the Lord will put an end to sin and sinners. In order to end the great war between good and evil there will be pain on both sides. God’s people experience the wrath of the dragon. But followers of the beast will experience the wrath of God against sin. The Lord has His people in all churches, but through the third angel’s message His mercy calls for everyone to separate from the dragon. “Come out of her, my people, lest you share in her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues. For her sins have reached to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities” (18:4, 5).&lt;BR /&gt;

    <shortdescription>Prior to Christ's second coming a decree will go forth ending the probation (a time to accept God's grace) of everyone living. This "close of probation" means that all who have rejected God's mercy will no longer have another chance to receive it.
</shortdescription>
    <article>&lt;B&gt;PROBATION. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
The opportunity provided humanity in which to accept divine grace and to prepare for eternal life, and the time allotted for this purpose. Seventh-day Adventists believe that an individual’s probation closes at death. In addition, they hold that prior to the second coming of Christ, a decree terminating probation for all then living will go forth: “He that is unjust, let him be unjust still . . . : and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: . . . And, behold, I come quickly and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be” (Rev. 22:11, 12). This decree marks the close of probation.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
During probationary time Christ is ministering as the Christian’s high priest in the heavenly sanctuary, applying to each repentant sinner the merits of His vicarious atonement and grace to triumph over the world, the flesh, and the devil. After the close of probation those who have rejected divine mercy will have no further opportunity, or second chance, to accept salvation, nor would they do so if the opportunity were given them. We do not know exactly the time of the close of probation for all humanity.</article>

    <shortdescription>Before Christ comes, the work of the "beast from the earth" and the "beast from the sea" will combine (Rev. 13:12, 15) to bring global persecution upon God's people, insisting on everyone worshiping the image of the beast.</shortdescription>
    <article>The symbolical image John saw in vision became animated by the miracle-working power of the second beast. The new organization begins to function, and like its predecessor, threatens with extinction those who refuse compliance. The first thing this newly formed image does is to “speak,” undoubtedly through its laws and enactments. Having spoken officially through its laws, the image next puts them into effect. Since these are religious laws, they will cut across the conscientious convictions of many. Force will be exercised in the carrying out of these enactments. This is the story of the ages. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Legislation in matters of religion has ever been followed by persecution. It was so during the Middle Ages: witness the massacre of the Albigenses, Waldenses, and others—by the civil power, to be sure, but prompted by the dominant church of the day. In its attempt to make all earth’s inhabitants give allegiance to the first beast (see on v. 8) second beast will issue a decree threatening with death all who maintain their loyalty to God. Everyone is affected by this legislation. Apparently only the faithful remnant refuse compliance (see v. 8 cf. ch. 12:17).</article>

    <shortdescription>The seven last plagues spoken in Revelation 15 and 16 are God's divine wrath on unrepentant sinners who refuse His mercy. They fall after the close of probation and before Christ's second coming in a relatively short period of time in the future.</shortdescription>
    <article>The seven last plagues upon the wicked are outlined in Revelation 15 and 16 and demonstrate the full and natural consequences of turning against God. The victims of these plagues have consistently resisted the Lord’s call to repent. They refuse and are forever settled in their decision to “blaspheme the God of heaven” (Revelation 16:11). The bloodshed of these events matches the crime of destroying God’s people over the centuries. As plagues fell on Egypt just before the release of the children of Israel, so also these plagues will fall on the earth just before Jesus returns. It appears that the seven last plagues are both literal and spiritual in nature. They are not universal in distribution and they do not harm God’s people. They are poured out without mercy.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;The First Five Plagues&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Revelation 15 introduces the seven last plagues of Revelation 16. In language reminiscent of the deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt, God’s people are about to see the power of the Almighty against injustice. Angels come from God’s throne room with bowls to be poured out on the earth. Like the incense from the prayers of God’s people upon the altar of incense, the wrath against sin has reached a point where injustice is found wanting.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
·         The First Bowl: When the first angel pours out a bowl on the earth, terrible and foul sores come on men “who had the mark of the beast and those who worshipped the image” (16:2). God’s people are sealed and unharmed from all the plagues.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
·         The Second Bowl: The result of the second angel pouring out a bowl is the sea becoming like blood and “every living creature in the sea died” (16:3). This obviously would cause a major catastrophe for the human race.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
·         The Third Bowl: The third bowl of wrath causes all fresh water to become as blood (16:4). Verses 5-7 show the “crime fits the punishment” since the wicked have “shed the blood of saints and prophets”.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
·         The Fourth Bowl: The sun scorches men as a result of the fourth bowl. In contrast with the fourth trumpet (which darkened the sun), here we see the opposite. Men still do not repent but “blasphemed the name of God” (16:9).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
·         The Fifth Bowl: In this plague the “throne of the beast” becomes shrouded in darkness. They also blasphemed God’s name and “did not repent” (16:11). Such darkness shows God’s power over the false power.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;The Sixth Bowl: The Euphrates Dries Up&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
When the sixth bowl is poured out the “great river Euphrates” is “dried up” so that the “way of the kings from the east might be prepared” (v. 12). Just as this river irrigated ancient Babylon, so in a spiritual sense it represents a lifeline for the beast. The kings of the east indicate the coming of the glory and power of God (see Matthew 24:27 and Ezekiel 43:1). The story of Cyrus and Darius conquering Babylon by diverting the river Euphrates, which gave them access to conquer the city, opens our understanding to the downfall of the beast power in the last days (see Daniel 5).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Like slippery flogs that jump all around, three evil spirits come out of the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet (the false trinity). They are “spirits of demons, performing signs” (v. 14). God warns His people to watch and not be deceived.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Armageddon and the Seventh Bowl&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
At the end of the sixth plague the evil spirits gather the kings of the earth “together to the place called in Hebrew, Armageddon” (16:16). While some believe this is a literal battle in a literal valley in Palestine, the language emphasizes that this is the great and final battle between Christ and Satan, between the forces of good and evil. It is the devil’s last great effort to exterminate God’s people. There are three stories that point us to the spiritual message of Armageddon (Deborah, Gideon, and Josiah). God’s people are outnumbered but in a hopeless situation the Lord brings victory.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The coming of the seventh plague is marked with a voice that says, “It is done!” (v. 17). There is lightening, thundering, and a mighty earthquake. Babylon crumbles, large hailstones fall, islands disappear, and people blaspheme God. Jesus comes and delivers His children. The Lord’s people never need to fear that any plague will ever come upon them (see Psalm 91:9, 10).</article>

    <shortdescription>The battle of Armageddon is a conflict between the forces of good and evil that will culminate just before the second coming of Christ. It is symbolic in nature, yet will end in the destruction of the wicked.</shortdescription>
    <article>ARMAGEDDON.  (From the Greek transliteration of an unknown Hebrew phrase usually thought to be Har-megiddo, “Mount Megiddo.”) The word “Armageddon” occurs in the Bible only in Rev. 16:16, as the Hebrew name for a “place” to which three “unclean spirits” (v. 13) gather “the kings of the earth” to “the battle of that great day of God Almighty” (v. 14)—John’s designation for what is popularly called the battle of Armageddon.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The gathering to Armageddon is the principal feature of the sixth plague (vs. 12–16). The sixth angel pours out his “bowl” upon “the great river Euphrates,” whose “water was dried up, to prepare the way for the kings from the east.” Then three “demonic spirits” resembling frogs go forth from the mouths of the “dragon,” the “beast,” and the “false prophet” to “the kings of the whole world, to assemble them for battle on the great day of God the Almighty” (vs. 13–16, RSV). The sixth plague closes with the nations of the earth gathered for battle, and the context implies that battle is joined as the seventh angel pours out the vial of the seventh plague.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In popular usage “Armageddon” means any major military conflict involving many nations, though usually without reference to the biblical meaning of the term. Armageddon was not given specific emphasis by earlier Protestant interpreters, but in the first four decades of the nineteenth century, the increased emphasis on the imminence of the end of several prophetic periods in the prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation led to increased interest in the subject of Armageddon. A large group of expositors taught that events foretold in Rev. 16:12–16 paralleled those of Dan. 11:44, 45, since in both instances the establishment of Christ’s eternal kingdom follows almost immediately. Furthermore, it was pointed out that the “king of the north” of Dan. 11:40–45, whom many identified as the Ottoman Empire, occupied the area drained by the Euphrates River, which is mentioned in Rev. 16:12. &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Their belief that the Turks were referred to by “the great river Euphrates” under the sixth trumpet (Rev. 9:14) strengthened the conviction that the Euphrates mentioned under the sixth plague must refer to the same power. The fact that throughout the nineteenth century the territory of the Ottoman Empire was progressively being diminished (“dried up”), coupled with belief in the imminence of the event foretold, tended to confirm this interpretation. Politically and in the public press the Turkish Empire was referred to as “the sick man of the East,” and its demise was supposed to be imminent. Contemporary events were construed as part of the drying-up process to which Rev. 16:12 referred. The “Eastern question” occupied the continuing attention of political leaders throughout the century, and of the interpreters of Bible prophecy as well.</article>

    <shortdescription>Babylon symbolizes an apostate church and is predicted to fall in Revelation 14:8. In Revelation 18 the fall of "the great harlot" is put forth, including the phrase "in one hour your judgment has come." She will destroy God's saints no more.
</shortdescription>
    <article>Babylon is a symbol in Revelation for apostate religious organizations that oppose Christ and His people on earth, especially at the close of time. In Revelation 14 we read about the fall of Babylon in the second angel’s message. Revelation 18 expands on her destruction with a final “loud cry” to “come out of her” so that people do not share in her final destruction. Whereas Revelation 17 describes Babylon as a “mother of harlots” (v. 5) and a prostitute who is executed, Revelation 18 uses a metaphor of a wealthy city being sacked. Though the term Babylon has been used over the centuries to describe different organizations that oppose God and persecute His people, modern Babylon stands for all Christian churches that have departed from the “everlasting gospel”, including the great Roman apostasy of the early Christian centuries and the more recent departure of mainstream Protestantism.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Fall of Babylon&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Revelation 18:2 tells us, “Babylon the great is fallen …” It explains, “For her sins have reached to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities” (v. 5). The time has come for God to judge her. This organization has seduced the “kings of the earth” to commit fornication with her (Revelation 17:2). What are her sins? Revelation tells us pride and arrogance (17:4 18:7, 16), defiance of God and persecution of His people (16:19 17:6 18:24), and an illicit alliance with the political powers of earth (17:2, 3 18:9). God gives people complete freedom of choice to choose salvation. Satan compels people with force to follow him.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Early Christians began to identify Babylon with Rome (1 Peter 5:13) as did the early Church Fathers like Tertullian and Irenaeus. During the Great Awakening at the dawn of the 19th century a growing number of Advent believers saw Babylon as a symbol for fallen apostate churches, especially those that were sustained by civil powers. The fall of Babylon is something that has been progressively happening, but will be complete when major Protestant churches collaborate with the Church of Rome in an attempt to coerce the conscience.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The punishment of Babylon outlined in Revelation 18 fits her crime. She is to “Render … double according to her works” (v. 7). Her luxury and glory came at the expense of others. She claims to sit as a queen, but she is a mother of harlots (17:5) and she will go down along with her daughters (churches which join her). Plagues will come to her, especially the seventh plague (see 16:19). The kings of the earth mourn, the merchants weep at her destruction. Yet, heaven exults in the final destruction of this organization for “in her was found the blood of prophets and saints, and of all who were slain on the earth” (18:24).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Loud Cry&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
The loud cry of Revelation 18 is God in His mercy saying, “Come out of her [Babylon], my people, lest you share in her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues” (v. 4). The Lord distinguishes between a false organization and individuals in apostate churches. This loud cry is heaven’s final appeal to humanity, the last message in Scripture calling humanity to accept the gospel. The call is united with the third angel’s message of Revelation 14:9-11 where Babylon’s counterfeit gospel is unveiled. This loud cry is a final bid to join God’s remnant people and separate from the false teachings that exalt humanity. This message began to go out around the close of the 2,300 year prophecy in 1844 A.D. and extends until the coming of Christ.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Those who take up the call and separate from Babylon, who become messengers of this final warning, will be like lights that “illuminate” the earth with glory (18:1). These servants of God will proclaim with power to the world heaven’s last call. While the powers of the earth unite to wage war against the commandments of God, there will be a commandment-keeping people who would rather die than accept the mark of the beast and transgress God’s laws. Many will come out of Babylon to join God’s last remnant people and stand for truth though threatened by a death decree. At this time probation will end. The final destiny of everyone will be forever fixed. Then Christ will come. Then will Babylon be destroyed.</article>

    <shortdescription>The 2nd coming of Christ is the blessed hope of the church, the grand climax of the gospel. The Saviour's coming will be literal, personal, visible, &amp; worldwide. The time of that event has not yet been revealed, but will come after the 7th plague.</shortdescription>
    <article>SECOND ADVENT.  The return of Jesus Christ to the earth as King of kings and Lord of lords. Though the phrase itself does not occur in the Bible, the teaching of Christ’s return constitutes a favorite theme of New Testamentwriters, who speak, for example, of our Lord’s appearance a “second time” (Heb. 9:28). Jesus Himself promised, “I will come again” (John 14:3).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The most frequent New Testament term for the Second Advent is parousia, meaning “presence” (literally, “a being beside”), and by extension the “coming” and “arrival” that result in “presence.” The word occurs 24 times in the New Testament. In Philippians 2:12 Paul contrasts his presence (parousia) among the Philippians with his absence (apousia) from them (cf. 2 Cor. 10:10). More frequently, however, the context requires the meaning “arrival” or “coming” for parousia. For instance, the arrival (parousia) of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus from Corinth brought joy to Paul and refreshed his spirit (1 Cor. 16:17, 18). The arrival (parousia) of Titus with good news from Corinth comforted Paul in his concern for the church there (2 Cor. 7:6). While a prisoner in Rome, Paul expressed the hope of being set free and of coming (parousia) again to the Philippians (Phil. 1:26).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Another term used for the Advent is apokalypsis, meaning “revelation,” “unveiling,” “disclosure” (1 Cor. 1:7 2 Thess. 1:7 1 Peter 1:7, 13). At His first coming Christ’s glory was hidden, and His deity was shrouded with humanity. But at His second appearing His glory and majesty are to be unveiled for all to behold (Matt. 24:30).</article>

    <shortdescription>When Christ returns for the second time to this earth, the righteous dead will be resurrected and, along with the righteous living, will be translated to heaven. The Bible teaches the wicked living at that time will be destroyed.
</shortdescription>
    <article>The New Testament presents the Second Advent as accompanied by the resurrection of the just (Luke 14:14 John 5:28, 29 6:40, 44 11:24 Acts 24:14, 15 1 Cor. 15:22, 23 1 Thess. 4:15–18), and this resurrection to life and immortality (Luke 20:35, 36 1 Cor. 15:52, 53) is the beginning of the millennium (Rev. 19 20).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Second Advent will mark the end of the present world order, and is therefore spoken of as the “end of the world” (Matt. 13:39, 40, 49 24:3 28:20). The phrase translated “end of the world” might better be rendered “completion of the age” or “consummation of the age.” The New Testament views time as a succession of ages. Eternity past is referred to literally as “from the ages” (Eph. 3:9 Col. 1:26 1 Cor. 2:7). &lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Eternity future is described by expressions meaning literally “into the ages” (translated “for ever” Luke 1:33 Rom. 1:25 2 Cor. 11:31 Jude 25 etc.), “into the ages of the ages” (rendered “for ever and ever” etc. Gal. 1:5 1 Peter 4:11 Rev. 1:18 etc.), or simply “ages to come” (Eph. 2:7). Human existence is thought of as divided into the present age and the age to come (Matt. 12:32 Eph. 1:21). The present is an evil age (Gal. 1:4 cf. Luke 20:34) in which men die. This age will continue until the Parousia and the judgment, when the age to come will begin. The earth will remain, but will later be renovated to remove all traces of sin and death.</article>

    <shortdescription>Millennium means "1,000 years."  It is a period of time in Revelation 20 marked by two resurrections. The righteous dead are resurrected and join the righteous living in heaven. Satan is bound to the earth. The wicked rise at the end to be judged.</shortdescription>
    <article>Revelation 20:3 says plainly that Satan is a prisoner in the abyss, or bottomless pit, for 1,000 years. The confusion is about the nature of this abyss. The Greek word is “abussos,” the same word used in the Septuagint in Genesis 1:2 for the pre-Creation earth. Also, Revelation 12:12 says Satan was bound to earth after the cross, and 2 Peter 2:4 says Satan and his angels were sent to “hell” to be reserved for judgment. Thus, they are reserved for judgment on earth. This also shows us that “hell” is on earth, not underneath it. The saints are shown judging in Revelation 20:4-6.</article>

    <shortdescription>The image in Nebuchadnezzar's dream that represented kingdoms is destroyed by a stone that becomes a mountain and fills the whole earth. The stone is cut out of a mountain without hands (i.e. God's kingdom that will rule forever).</shortdescription>
    <article>The word "stone" used in Daniel 2:45 is used to describe slabs, sling stones, hewn stones, stone vessels, precious stones. The word “rock” is frequently used of God (Deut. 32:4, 18 1 Sam. 2:2 etc.), and the interpretation offered by Daniel is of itself sufficient to identify the symbol as God's kingdom. The reference to this kingdom being cut out "without hands" show it has a superhuman origin. It is to be founded, not by the ingenious hands of man, but by the mighty hand of God.</article>

    <shortdescription>The Bible teaches that Jesus is coming soon. But what happens next? Where do the saved (righteous) people go? What about the lost people? And what happens to the earth? Revelation 20 discusses a 1,000 year period of time after Christ comes.</shortdescription>
    <article>The Bible teaches that Jesus is coming soon. But what happens next? Where do the saved (righteous) people go? What about the lost (unrighteous) people? And what happens to the earth? Many Bible students have asked these questions and a variety of different answers have been posed. In Revelation 20 a time period of 1,000 years is described from which we get the word “millennium”. Immediately after Jesus comes the Bible tells us Satan is “bound ... for a thousand years” (v. 2). During this time the righteous are in heaven and at the end of the millennium the Holy City will descend to this earth. Let’s look at what the Bible says will happen at the beginning of, during, and after the millennium.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Beginning of the Millennium&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Revelation 19 and 20 flow together as a single unit. In Revelation 19:11-21 Christ comes to the earth. In graphic language the wicked are destroyed (see also 2 Thessalonians 1:7-8). In Revelation 20:4-6 there is clear reference to a first resurrection of the righteous at the coming of Christ. In 1 Thessalonians 4:16-18 Paul also describes this glorious day when we are caught up in the air to be with the Lord. Jesus tells us He will come back to earth and take us to be where He is (John 14:1-3). During this time Satan is bound for a thousand years. He is cast into a bottomless pit and remains there until the end of the millennium. The earth has already been ruined by the seven last plagues, but it is now completely desolate of people (Revelation 20:5). We find an Old Testament description of this time where the earth is “without form and void” (Jeremiah 4:23), which is the same language describing the earth before anything was created (Genesis 1:2).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;During the Millennium&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
While Satan is bound to this earth, the righteous are in heaven with Jesus. Revelation 20:4 speaks of “thrones” and “judgment” and “reigning with Christ.” Even though the wicked are slain at the coming of Christ, God’s compassion and justice is to strong that the righteous will be able to review all the records of every person in the universe. A period of time is given for the saints to review the cases, especially of the lost people and fallen angels. Paul says, “Do you not know that the saints will judge the world?” (1 Corinthians 6:2). Jude 6 describes how even angels will be judged: “And the angels who did not keep their proper domain, but left their own abode, He has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day.” Satan and his evil angels will be bound to this desolate earth for 1,000 years with nothing to do but reflect on their sinful acts.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;After the Millennium&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
The Bible says, “Now when the thousand years have expired, Satan will be released from his prison” (Revelation 20:7). He goes out to deceive the nations, which means the wicked will be raised back to life. This resurrection is described by Jesus when He speaks of “the resurrection of condemnation” (John 5:29). Revelation 20:5 describes these as “the rest of the dead” who “did not live again until the thousand years were finished.” As Satan once more deceives the wicked, he gathers them to unite and attack the “camp of the saints and the beloved city” (v. 9). But they are destroyed. This destruction comes in conjunction with the “great white throne" judgment (v. 11) which demonstrates once and for all the justice and mercy of God, even in the final destruction of sin. This destruction is described as happening with “fire and brimstone” (v. 10) and its results are eternal. Though some interpret this hellfire as never ending, the Bible shows that the nature of this “forever” fire is to last as long as it takes to do its job (see Malachi 4:1-3). This consuming fire is spoken of also in Jude 7, 2 Peter 2:6 and Isaiah 47:14.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
While some believe that the millennium happens after 1,000 years of human progress (postmillennial) and others think the millennium is symbolic of the whole Christian Era (amillennial), the Bible describes it as a literal 1,000 years after the second coming of Christ (postmillennial). Following the destruction of the wicked, Satan, his evil angels, and all sin, the earth will be cleansed with fire. John then describes what he saw next: “Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away” (Revelation 21:1). What a glorious time that will be!</article>

    <shortdescription>Like the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, here is a cosmic view of the great battle between good and evil, between Christ and Satan. As Jesus breaks open the seven seals holding a scroll shut, dramatic events take place.</shortdescription>
    <article>The book of Revelation is filled with symbols, typical of Bible books which speak about the time of the end. In chapter 6 we read about seals, living creatures, and horses. Like the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, here is a cosmic view of the great battle between good and evil, between Christ and Satan. As Jesus breaks open the seven seals holding a scroll shut, dramatic events take place that describe the progress of the gospel, the reaction of the world, and the impact on God’s people throughout the ages. There is not only a historical application to the seven seals, but a universal application to every person presented with the gospel. Chapter 6 ends with the question, “Who can stand?” Chapter 7 answers that question before it moves to the seventh seal found in Revelation 8.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Revelation 6 opens with four horsemen riding out from the throne room of heaven (see Revelation 4 and 5) with messages. What do they mean?&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
·         First Seal: A white horse goes out with a bow. A crown is on his head and he went out “conquering and to conquer.” This picture describes the purity of the apostolic church (A.D. 31-100) when its faith and zeal made perhaps the greatest advancement of the gospel in history. So also does the reception of the gospel bring the white purity of Christ’s righteousness into our hearts when we conquer sin.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
·         Second Seal: A red horse next emerges taking “peace from the earth, and that people should kill one another …” (v. 4). The violent persecution of church under the hands of the Roman Caesars portrays the condition of the church from about A.D. 100-313. The color of this horse reminds us of the shed blood of Christ who brings peace. The gospel is also like a sword which can cause division as well.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
·         Third Seal: Next a black horse rides out with a pair of scales and a voice says, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine” (v. 6). If white represents purity, then black would speak of corruption which came into Christianity when church and state were united in the 4th century. References to barley and a denarius speak of a time of famine for the word of God (the Bread of life).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
·         Four Seal: The fourth horse is a pale-green color and its rider is called “Death, and Hades followed with him” (v. 8). It was given power to kill with the sword, hunger, and death. We are reminded of the dark ages before the Reformation (A.D. 538-1517) when society was so weakened by the ravages of war it could hardly protect itself. Unless the gospel is received and grows in the life (like a living green plant), it turns pale and dies.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
·         Fifth Seal: Here we see symbolized the voice of martyrs crying out, “How long, O Lord, holy and true, until You judge and avenge our blood …?” (v. 10). They are assured a time is coming when all will be made right. This would be very meaningful to those persecuted just before and during the great Reformation in the later Middle Ages (A.D. 1517-1755). They are given a white robe as all followers of Jesus receive when accepting Christ’s righteousness.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
·         Sixth Seal: Cosmic disturbances take place when the sixth seal is opened. There is a great earthquake, the sun becomes black, the moon turns blood red, and the stars of heaven fall. Perhaps the great Lisbon earthquake marks well the beginning of this period (A.D. 1755) which not long after was followed by a great darkening of the sun in 1780 and an unusually spectacular meteorite shower in 1833. This period was called the Great Awakening and opened a time of remarkable interest in Bible prophecy.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Revelation 6:14-16 indicates even greater catastrophes will happen before Christ comes. The question at the end of the chapter, “Who is able to stand?” is answered in Revelation 7. In chapter 8 we return to the seventh seal.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
·         Seventh Seal: When this seal is opened seven angels are given seven trumpets to sound. References to trumpets, a golden censer, the altar, and incense speak of the sanctuary service when the prayers of God’s people ascend and the Lord responds. Trumpets will again sound and God will act on behalf of His people just before Christ comes.</article>

    <shortdescription>At the end of the millennium Christ, His people, and the Holy City (the New Jerusalem) return to this earth. Jesus comes as King over all the earth.
</shortdescription>
    <article>The capital of that new earth will be the New Jerusalem, which, after the millennium, descends from heaven and is established upon this earth (Rev. 21:1, 2, 10 Heb. 11:10, 14–16). This city is described in detail in Rev. 21 and 22. The presence of the city signifies the presence of God, for after John saw the Holy City descending he “heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God” (Rev. 21:3).</article>

    <shortdescription>At the end of the millennium when Christ and His people return to the earth, the wicked are resurrected. This is the great white throne judgment where the wicked are judged. It gives Satan one last opportunity to deceive.</shortdescription>
    <article>The Bible teaches that there will be two general resurrections—one of the just, to life, and the other of the unjust, to condemnation (John 5:28, 29 Acts 24:15). These two general resurrections are separated by the “thousand years” of Rev. 20:4, 5. Those who have part in the first resurrection are “blessed and holy” (v. 6) and over them the “second death,” “the lake of fire” at the close of the millennium (v. 14), has no power. The first resurrection—“the resurrection of the just” (Luke 14:14)—takes place in connection with the Second Advent (1 Cor. 15:22, 23 1 Thess. 4:15–18).</article>

    <shortdescription>After the great white throne judgment at the end of the 1,000 years the wicked are destroyed. Fire comes down from heaven and consumes them. This lake of fire is spoken of as the second death and is eternal.
</shortdescription>
    <article>As to the nature and effect of hellfire, Bible teaching is clear. In Matt. 3:12 sinners are compared to chaff that is burned with “unquenchable fire” (cf. Mark 9:43–48 Luke 3:9). In Matt. 25:41 the wicked are represented as being consigned to “everlasting [aioµnios] fire.” And in Matt. 5:22 Jesus referred to the final judgment on the wicked as “hell fire.” All three passages refer to the fires of the last day that will devour the wicked and all their works. This fire will purge the earth (2 Peter 3:10–12 Luke 3:17). It will be ignited after all the finally impenitent who come up in the second resurrection (Rev. 20:5) are marshaled under Satan around the New Jerusalem (v. 9). (In other words, it is not burning now.) The devil, his evil confederates, and all who have been deceived by them are cast into this lake of fire (vs. 10, 14, 15).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This fire is the second death, from which there will be no resurrection. The word  usually translated “everlasting” or “eternal,” and once “forever,” means literally, “lasting for an age,” in the sense of being continuous and not subject to capricious change. The English words “everlasting” and “eternal,” on the other hand, imply duration unlimited. The duration signified must be determined by the nature of the person or thing it describes. In the New Testamentthis word is used to describe both the fate of the wicked and the reward of the righteous. Following the above principle, we find that the reward of the righteous is life to which there is no end, whereas the reward or judgment of the wicked is death to which there is no end (cf. Rom. 6:23). In John 3:16 “everlasting life” stands in contrast to “perish.”&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The word “unquenchable” may be similarly understood. Jeremiah predicted that God would kindle a fire in Jerusalem that would “not be quenched” (Jer. 17:27). This prediction was fulfilled when the city was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar (2 Chron. 36:19–21). Obviously that fire is not burning today. It was unquenchable in the sense that the Jews were unable to put it out. It burned until it destroyed their city and went out.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <Image1Desc>Destruction of the wicked is a painful act for God.

Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?
(Ezekiel 33:11)</Image1Desc>

    <shortdescription>After the millennium and the wicked are judged and destroyed, the earth is purified with fire and then God creates the earth new. The New Jerusalem has become the center of the universe. God's people will live forever on the earth.
</shortdescription>
    <article>Revelation 21 tells of a new heaven and a new earth. By using the word "new," John is probably emphasizing the fact that the new heavens and earth will be created from the purified elements of the old, and thus be new in quality, different. The new heavens and the new earth are, then, a re-creation, a forming anew of existing elements, and not a creation ex nihilo. Compare 2 Peter 3:13.</article>
